@Iron_Spike Though at least in the latter case they're just NOT getting the full nutritional benefit, as opposed to potentially wrecking their intestinal flora.
===
@Iron_Spike It's not people who experiment with different ways of making ceviche, it's just asshole brodudes deciding that they can thaw a steak on the counter and then eat it straight out of the package, or its hippie-dippie types refusing to ever apply heat to a carrot.
===
@Iron_Spike 100% of what makes the fads awful is that the people doing them aren't actually studying up on what makes the myriad examples of raw dishes work, they just decide to not cook things.
===
Her heels should not be leaving the mat.

The whole point is an explosive extension from the floor, starting in what's almost a squat with the body's weight on the heels and straightening the legs to a standing position with core tight to bring the bar up to clean position.

@govkristinoem You are evil. Go find a house to get landed on by

@elle91 @MaraWilson Jesus is actually hiding in an egg, and if you find him then you get salvation but if he goes unfound by the end of the day it's 7 years bad luck.
===
Weird how the people who hate the idea of vaccine passports seem pretty okay with ICE operating in our cities and demanding immigration paperwork.
===
@transscribe @arthur_affect Nobody's born lambada, borscht, goose, or turnkey.
===
Matt Gaetz also vehemently denies the vicious rumors that he sodomizes goats, llamas, and sheep.

As well as the awful lies that he regularly attempts to purchase the bodily wastes of female celebrities to bathe in and consume them.
===
Oh you think the lol is your ally? But you merely adopted the lol.

I was born in it, molded by it. I didn't see the hehehehe until I was already a man; by then it was nothing to me but lollerskates!
===
Of course Lil Nas X is powerful, he had to defeat Lil Nas I through IX to get to where he is.

@thetomzone @MaraWilson War orphans have it too good.

Confession: I was never actually rolling on the floor laughing my ass off.

I have been living a lie all these years.

@RaxKingIsDead @MaraWilson SPICY FOODS GIVE ME A BIT OF A RUNNY NOSE, OKAY

I Have No Meowth And I Must Scream
===
@MaraWilson No disrespect for MY cyclopean captain
===
@daveweigel @arthur_affect Also Disneyland is not a right nor important to democracy
===
@letsgoayo They've been on this bullshit for a while now, even people making their own decisions are cancel culture run amok because obviously they only did so because of pressure.

Funny how the only indepebdent decision we can make is bigotry.
===
Weird how conservatives are so upset about a gay Black man, I mean they loved Dean Browning.
===
@choochoobear They can have my cell phone porn when they pry it from my warm, sticky hands.
===
@AngryBlackLady Kevin* deserved so much better.

*swap Kevin for half the supporting cast and this remains true.

@zeldawilliams You versus the guy she tells you not to worry about dot jpeg
===
This is shit that was strongly impressed upon me when I was working with a trainer.

Maybe if Margarine spent less time fucking hers...
===
Darcy: Wait a sec...

Wanda had us all in a fake TV show she created, where I was me but playing someone else.

And there's movies with this actress who looks just like me...
===
@arthur_affect Remember how a big thing with GG was the whole "we REAL gamers suffered for our hobby!"
===
@arthur_affect Basically exactly how coding was women sitting at desks until men could convince themselves that it was problem solving and thus manly.
===
If you're doing a set you can then return to the floor and then complete the full motion again, or from the clean position you can complete a set of overhead presses before returning to the floor.

None of that involves hopping or wiggling the way she did.
===
A Boy Named Sue, but it's about self-acceptance.
===
When Barclay took over the Enterprise after encountering the Cytherean probe, why did the crew not simply open RegEdit?
===
Greenwald got excessive goodwill for principles he never actually held, thanks to work he mostly didn't do but was glad to take credit for, because there was a moment when his pretence of caring about transparency seemed to align with people's frustrations at neoliberalism.
===
The heat death of the universe has arrived.

As all motion ceases and all approaches absolute stillness and cold, the last remaining subatomic particles - if anyone was around to observe them - can be observed forming into a pattern momentarily before even they cease:

IT'S A BOY

@fryman1701 Take this and make it that you are also every other person in existence and it's The Egg.
===
@kat_blaque There's nothing "former" about them, tbh.

Mostly they just found new targets.
===
@ChrisWarcraft I saw Greg Kelly in the closet smoking weed and one of the weed looked at me.
===
*Having fun with a friend*

*starts to hear buzzing sound in distance*

"What is that sound?"

*friend grimly retrieves shotgun from grandfather clock*

"Time flies."

"What?"

*Buzzing gets louder, friends pumps shotgun*

"Time flies."
===
Gotye released a hit song and now he's just somebody that we used to know.
===
@letsgoayo Nice
===
I don't know if I've ever linked to this before on here, but it's worth reading through to the end.  https://t.co/K36uo7exv2
===
What she's doing is making up for a lack of strength by using the extra motion for momentum.

But this is a good way to pull something, or wreck your back.

Keeping the core tight is vital to ensure you're not putting lateral stress where it can cause serious injury.
===
You, pedestrian: Ted Lasso

Me, urbane: Theodore Lariat
===
For a clean and jerk instead of stopping at the clean position, resting at the clavicles, the upwards motion continues with a hip thrust, a quick rock of the pelvis to add enough momentum to then continue the bar's path with a lift from clean to overhead.

Then return to clean.
===
@arthur_affect There is beef, but it's one-sided, because on the one side there's the Jacobin-adjacent clique around the Bruenigs who drive most of the harassment because they hold a grudge re: Matt's shitty behavior, and on the other side Noah is clearly not holding a grudge.
===
MTG is doing what looks like a clean and jerk into overhead press.

Two 25lb plates on a 45lb bar means 95lbs cleared.

But the power behind the lift is supposed to come from the extension, not from a hop.

That hopping means she's not driving upwards from the heels.
===
@AngryBlackLady Everyone's mocking the pull-ups but I'm wincing at the lift.
===
These ads for a zombie match-3 game keeps positing situations in which the protagonist is starting out in their underwear in public and I am really beginning to wonder just how often these people see this occur in real life.
===
If Star Wars exists in the MCU is Mace Windu still played by Samuel L Jackson and do they ever notice he looks like Nick Fury?
===
@hottestsingles Tag your nsfw content, please
===
Right-wing christians are just mad because for all their big talking of defeating Satan none of them ever thought of just twerking on him.
===
@arthur_affect I've become partial to referring to someone as "my good bitch".
===
@RepCawthorn Don't forget to mention you opposed these
===
What if you had a near-death experience that actually wasn't, and your life you're currently living is actually all being experienced in the split-second before you die?
===
Just remember this to stop mixing up Gaetz and Gertz:

A before E, suspicious with teens
E before R, not suspicious so far https://t.co/wmF0Uxlz1p
===
People who want to molest and abuse children seek targets they can control.

Teaching kids that they can say no when they feel uncomfortable is literally the opposite of what they'd want.

So if someone's speaking out against teaching consent...
===
@arthur_affect Just a whole group of people who see him as a fair target because he doesn't show "solidarity" when "leftist" dudes are getting called out for shitty behavior.

And Liz's comments I guarantee come at least in part from that grudge.
===
@dog_rates What else can he say but, "You're welcome"?
===
This Popeyes has a CBD shop attached and I feel like someone missed the obvious by not having it just be a straight up dispensary.
===
@chadloder Good dog
===
At this point I just assume that 100% of the "you just want to sexualize kids because you're a pedo!" shit, in response to people talking about children's bodily autonomy and sex education, is projection

Cumming is always great.

Everyone loves Cumming. https://t.co/C8yMI6NX22

Weird how GOPers keep turning out to be pedophiles even as their party embraces a conspiracy theory accusing the Dems of being pedophiles.

@gregkellyusa You know that you could actually look up what weed does instead of making up shit no one will believe, right?

Random person: You were amazing in Room!

Carol Danvers: *confused*

@SamMaggs @BlairBroon *Morbo voice* That is not how wireless internet works
===
Not only does normalizing putting your pronouns in your bio help trans and nonbinary people, you also get to piss off the sort of chuds who say "pronouns in bio" when they have no other argument.
===
@kaludiasays @letsgoayo Darcy totally calls Jane Padme to tease her, and Jane calls Darcy Max.
===
@arthur_affect Literally every time these types are going after him it's some shit about how he allegedly defames people on the left all the time and if you follow that thread far enough it comes down to who did and did not defend Matt when his sexually harassing behavior went public.
===
Tucker Carlson seems to remain convinced that his expression communicates serious journalistic concern and skepticism, but mostly it's the dog who saw you throw the ball, but didn't see it go anywhere, and now doesn't know where the ball is.
===
@letsgoayo Wait til they hear what drinking all day does.
===
Daddy is trending, because all you sinners won't stop appropriating it!
===
It's funny that transphobes throw accusations of pedophilia around so freely considering that Zucker is just one of a large handful of them who just actually are pedophiles.

It's almost like it's just projection.
===
@baileybenns How dare.
===
@chibikonatsu @arthur_affect For me, 'my dude' is lightly mocking, 'my good bitch' is when you done goofed.
===
I had an idea for a prank but Twitter's choice of picture preview setup sort of ruined it.

Instacart puts the thing to refresh the shopper app right above the thing to log out.

Guess which of the two prompts you to verify you intended to select them?

*Steve and Bucky watching Scott Pilgrim*

Steve: Lucas Lee didn't seem so bad. Good lookin', too.

Bucky: *looks at the camera*

Stacey Abrams should be a governor right now, and Kemp should be in prison.

@GailSimone Yes you do.

Wow, this blew up.

@arthur_affect It's projection.

@vtZenith So... I love my 2D self. Same name, my experiences, and I don't voice act for him. I basically just use him as myself. But I do prefer my real self. How I look, how I walk, my dedication and my confidence. All of it comes from the person I actually AM. Not my Vtuber.
===
@KicchinNezumi Here for you regardless bro.

@GoddesUseless DECIDE

@ShadowHeart230 No clue tbh. I'm not very good with words. I suffer from large (yet smooth) brain.
===
@vtZenith @TheLewdzer Its so good! Also might be biased because I love both of you but it's just really cool
===
You're not swag enough to be my landlord smh. You're just my landboss.
===
@tyrannotiny My brain may be large, but it is smootj
===
Hey, fuckers.
Fuck you.
I love you. So Fuck you.
===
Everyone who draws me makes me look so fucking badass I'm just astounded I love artists.
===
Friends! We're friends. https://t.co/H4XaTA8eTp
===
@SeraphiVT True
===
Are my friends in Valsquad or am I in their Squad....?
===
@Viosmic Bet bet. I think I main silvia though. She's just super useful.
===
@DeezyEight Let's get some love for Sakuna actually
===
@HamuAria Thats just wrong
===
@NikBounty Bro, you cultured!!!!
Is like... Every member of gen 3 is really cool individually but they are also the ones with the best bond!
===
@NikBounty I mean, only the best for the best?
===
@NikBounty Good bros!
===
@NikBounty Libra... Oh, it's all high!!! :0
===
@NikBounty Every Holo--- Gen 3
===
@NikBounty Man, you're based, dope and also superlit
===
@NikBounty Glasses fosho😍🙌🏻
===
@NikBounty Gladly 🥺
===
@AlnicPen I have 100% faith that you can!
===
@domiwoof1 I'm excited for a road trip to Texas I'm planning in a few months once my friends and I are fully vaccinated~
https://t.co/BTUo2y8VZ1
===
Thank you everyone who came by the stream! Still working out the capture card issues unfortunately, but I had a lot of fun chatting with you all and playing with @Hengagenga @hibagotanQuatch and CTR 🖤
And thank you to @ZplaxZeep for the raid!!
===
@LarsBenito This is a really neat idea! Sign me up! 🖤
===
@SmashSkost Will do! 👀
===
@Fhfjj13580424 Good morning, Moski!
===
@Ghost_Prodigy Ooooh interesting, I'll definitely remember that 👀
===
@lilithvanille That's exactly right, conquest is no fun if there isn't much resistance and we would squash all before us far too easily https://t.co/hTv1omR3vE
===
Good morning, my sweet souls! Today is another quiet day from me while I work on commissions, but might stream some Monster Hunter later~
Today I want to know, what's something you're proud of? Something you've done, or made, or even not done?
===
@Ghost_Prodigy Haha same though, those captains are rough to get through sometimes
===
@MurasakiSeren Feel free to use me as practice! 🖤 https://t.co/xAjV8v8eOQ
===
@B34RGURZ Dude I'm impressed you still have the link for that game :o
===
@vtuberlili Your art is always lovely, so feel free to go nuts~ Seiso or seison't, whatever you like 🖤 https://t.co/YENWroldal
===
Good morning my dearest souls! It's Friday which means we have successfully made it through another week (and April Fools). And that means more Monster Hunter Rise later today!
Do you have anything exciting planned for the weekend??
===
@geld_the_gob Hello hello, I'm Lilith Nox! I'm a demon that's trapped in this mortal plane, so I spend my time making friends and streaming a variety of games for your entertainment~
You shouldn't rob me because it wouldn't go well for you 😈 https://t.co/TzjSMuzSlY
===
@Ghost_Prodigy Ooooh that's a slick setup :o
Also is that Death's mask I see chilling in the corner there? 👀
===
@willsg98 Continuing on with Kill la Kill unless y'all wanna watch something else
===
@lilithvanille I prefer to stick them in the oven, but tbh when I have low blood sugar or bad depression then you bet I'm microwaving them because it's less effort
===
Totally was not up until 6am playing ERBS, I don't know what you're talking about &gt;.&gt;
===
@SmashSkost I wanna hang out with you on streams :o
===
@NerdyAsuna Take the time you need, those side effects are certainly no joke!
===
@ona_alt Don't beat yourself up in your sleep, damn lol
===
Good morning, my darling souls! Slept in a tiny bit today, but now I'm up and ready to go again!
===
@Shou_Crit I chalk it up to people being lazy at this point. Because calling tech support and making them think for you seems like less effort than finding the answer yourself, even if it takes way longer
===
@CarianTwitch So pretty *0*
===
@RunekeeperTV Crap I totally did forget to eat, thank you, Rune ;A;
===
The desire to stream Monster Hunter is strong, but I have commissions I need to work on today ;A;
===
@ErisQT @aicandii If anyone bullies you, I will straight up devour their soul. Just point me in their direction 👿
===
@domiwoof1 That's a big yikes from me, damn. Well, you're a cool dude so if they wanna just be thirsty instead of getting to know you, then it's their loss
===
@Ghost_Prodigy I just woke up, so haven't experienced much of the day yet, but I'm sure it'll be great! How are you enjoying Outriders so far?
===
@CrimsonVT Agreed! Besides the expected server issues and the crashing I've had, it's honestly been a really solid and fun experience so far
===
@willsg98 Well enough, I just keep going to bed later than I should lol
===
@LarsBenito You have! Gonna get this demon to simp, damn~
===
@domiwoof1 I feel like that's just general Discord etiquette, or at least it should be. Like spend some time talking to the person in the server *at least* before trying to add them?
===
Good morning/afternoon my darling souls! I slept in a bit because I was up way too late last night.. &gt;.&gt;
I probably won't be here much today as I really don't like April Fool's, but I want you to know that I love you all and want you to stay safe 🖤🖤🖤
===
@VTuberCinera Cone of shame!
===
And we're live! Playing some Monster Hunter Rise with @Hengagenga !! Let's clap some monsters!
https://t.co/Jv6TpLq7kL

#Vtuber #ENVtuber #smallstreamer
===
@Hengagenga I'm not quite sure what that is, but it looks tasty af
===
Happy #TransDayOfVisibility 🖤
I'm a nonbinary streamer, so I fall under the trans umbrella. I do my best to create a safe place for people to feel like they can be themselves and relax while they laugh at me failing miserably at video games!

===
@Lilin_VDaemon I'm far older than the current concept of star signs, but I suppose the time of my birth roughly lines up with Sagittarius https://t.co/QaPDGxyL7h
===
Good morning, my dearest souls! Today is the start of a new week so let's give it our all!

I also noticed this and I just "hehehe 404 error, follower count not found" 🤣 https://t.co/rRh6IQICd1
===
@SilverSubtle I've never actually done one, much less on my own, so the planning is stressful lol But glad to hear you had fun with yours!
===
@LarsBenito So good!! :O
===
Thank you to everyone who came by the stream and kept me company, we finally beat the pig mech boss and started moving on with the story!
And of course a huge thank you to @CrimsonVT for the raid 🖤
===
@SilverSubtle Red and black. My wardrobe is almost entirely black 😅
===
@MothMillie Is all of the above an option?
===
@Fhfjj13580424 Good morning, Moski! How's your day been today~?
===
@MothmanVT Pancake looks like such a good girl 😍
===
@ona_alt I'm a Sagittarius :o
===
Honestly I probably won't even be online for April Fool's, I'm not a fan of how people handle it online tbh https://t.co/L5ovS42WNu
===
@Sagikitsune Saaaame. Mondays are always the sleepiest days
===
@vtuberlili Nightmares suck, but you're okay now 🖤 https://t.co/Znjc2buMDx
===
@Shou_Crit I don't understand it either tbh, especially since resources are widely available to learn those kinds of skills very easily and for free https://t.co/8vksE2iKDM
===
@AlnicPen Oooooh glasses should look very nice on your character!
===
My tablet for my computer decided to shit itself, hooraaaaaaaaay -.-
Time to charge the ipad and continue working on that instead. Good thing the program I use for my art is cross compatible
===
@SilverSubtle I dreamed about the road trip I've been planning and seeing my friends~
===
@Shou_Crit Because technical support is so widely available, people don't bother learning what we would consider basic skills for their technology. It's the same thing that happened with cars, as mechanics became more common people stopped learning how to change their oil or a flat tire
===
And we're live! Come keep me company while I run through sidequests in Ni no Kuni~
https://t.co/Jv6TpL8vWb
#Vtuber #ENVtuber #smallstreamer
===
@AlnicPen It did. It's been a little weird for a while now, but it finally just kicked the bucket I guess
===
Finally set up the sound alerts on my channel, so on Friday y'all will have the ability to mess around with those~
===
@LarsBenito @lyssanah Oh my~
===
Schedule for this week! Friday might be a collab, might be more Monster Hunter Rise, not quite sure yet~ 
Any rest day is subject to guerilla MonHun streams as well!
[All times in EST] https://t.co/mZ0noUtzKi
===
@ona_alt Best demons gonna take over the world together?
===
@N7IRL You should put the photo in a reply to your setup tweet
===
@MuppetArmy76 It lives in my brain FOREVER!
===
@NikBounty all of them at once
===
@NikBounty i care u even when you're not a white-haired anime boy
===
@N7IRL @jessesingal Damn I knew there was a reason I followed you back before I'd even fully moved off Facebook to twitter years ago.
===
@OregonRolledA20 Creating content for my homebrew Sentinels Of The Multiverse game! Superheroes in the bustling city of Desoto, Washington.
===
@GTGamesLLC Legacy's favourite chip!
===
@GSBCE1of4 @GailSimone Ooo, is there a Laura Palmer Funko Pop?
===
@RottenInDenmark I say this as a dude who once witnessed a fellow dude tell a woman he'd just met that he could tell her breasts were real and was just INCENSED that she was offended by that.
===
@LoneWolf343 @SlacktivistFred Holy crap, he's a wee little leprechaun man, and he's lying about it. That's so sad!
===
@jennaroselion @emtothea Nah, it's cool, I play D&amp;D.
===
@Veloci_trap_tor @alexsteed Her lumbar spine is going to be JELLY in a few years.
===
@MelanieScrofano "None of you matter."
===
@BubuBORG @KrakoaWelcomes Twitter blocked this as "potentially sensitive content," and, look at those eyes. "Sensitive" indeed.
===
@ghweldon Wouldn't he split that vote with Kermit?
===
@BronzeAgeBabies He wasn't Galactus' herald, he was Galactus' jobber.
===
@Remember_Sarah Not to mention that you really had no way of knowing what that entertainment was going to be like - there was no website to go to, the trailers were a minute long and incredibly hard to find ...
===
@amadcartoonist Wonder Man, and he thinks it's hiLARious.
===
@LoneWolf343 @SlacktivistFred Well, it's the same thing as Trump's weight - you're announcing the emperor has no clothes.
===
@chrisespod @lizbethanne Have you read any of the Marvel Godzilla comics?
Also, who's your favourite ape-themed bad guy in comics?
===
For context, CrossFit is now distancing itself from Congresscritter Greene for being ... well, HER. https://t.co/owLcgKBMJ3
===
@InspectorHound4 @MaraWilson I hear these stories about people falling in love as physical therapist and patient and I'm, like, really? The best I can hope for is that my PT thought I was actually a vertebrate by the end of it.
===
@SlacktivistFred A little reductive - some of those "jerks" turned out to be women who were so damaged by society that they tried to force themselves to be men and broke under the strain. Well, at least one of my good friends is in that situation.
===
@GRUMM9301 Favourite preparation of cheese?
===
@MojosWork *drools*
Sooooooo many swords!
===
@daveweter @KurtBusiek @GailSimone It's now the wasp nest, I think.
===
@thatpaulmoffett I don't want to duplicate here, so I'll just add in The Good Place, Orphan Black and The Magicians.
===
@strictlyworse Oh! I'm going to be making the battlecasserole next week. The boys are looking forward to it.
===
@leftcoastsuit @Mik3Ferguson @Remember_Sarah And it is.
===
@brooksbarnesNYT That's ... that's a LOT.
===
@whyaredads From friends who were struggling with it, don't do too deep a dive. Like, having someone around that you can chat with, surf your phone during the most recent slow-mo fight scene, you won't miss a thing.
===
@AmerHysteria When I was four, we went to a place where you could drive through wildlife pens, including a giraffe pen. One of them walked up to our car, leaned in and stole my apple, from my hand, with it's two-foot, purple, spiky tongue. I have issues with giraffes, is what I'm saying.
===
@GSBCE1of4 @daveweter @GailSimone If those actually have a drop of human blood in them, I shall eat a bug. Well, I sometimes back with cricket flour, so technically that's not a sacrifice, but, still.
===
@xmenbutgay As a cishet dude, I am totally unequipped to comment, but I'm hear to listen to the conversation, for sure. There's definitely a, "and then they kiss," vibe to all of their interactions.
===
@DanielleNicki I still do.
===
@BidenHarrisWon2 @froomkin I think instead they want people qualified to support the corporations.
===
@alexsteed Please tell me you responded, "Speaking of dads, let me tell you about my podcast ..."
===
@whyaredads @apaullo95 I can't think of a movie that's funnier than "What About Bob?" Movies on the same level, sure, and maybe in the moment funnier, but that I would consistently rank above it?
===
@strictlyworse *youth pastor vibes intensify*
===
@RottenInDenmark I fully believe that he had a conversation that started with him giving what he thought was a compliment and being told that it was disgusting, though.
===
@whyaredads @Remember_Sarah @LilNasX @Nightline That's actually a pretty rad news segment. Very measured approach to the matter, and Sarah was a big part of that.
===
@rdonoghue Oh, indeed. Someone rules lawyering with the DM is playing with fire. And cold. And acid. And poison. And ...
===
@BubuBORG @KrakoaWelcomes Being named "Giraud," for start.
===
@KBSpangler It came on suddenly, too. I got the shot at 9 in the morning, and noon I'm making a sandwich and it was like someone cracked me on the arm with a hammer.
===
@willianpbusch I can only speak for myself, but I'm ALWAYS somewhere in between, with a lot of nat 1s in the mix.
===
@seankreynolds One note:
Get your jab
We'll be fab

Beautifully done.
===
@whyaredads @fangirlJeanne My favourite thing about both movies is that basically none of the plotlines are totally unique to the movie, it's just Gunn taking existing comics canon and playing with it, like a kid with Lego.
===
@DougHageman Before or after I also say, "Who's a good pup?"

Regardless, happy birthday, good pup.
===
@JimZub @SteveEllisArt "Even Rock Python?"
"ESPECIALLY Rock Python."
===
@strictlyworse So sorry to hear that.
===
@SlacktivistFred I think I missed something - is Ben Shapiro notably short?
===
@RottenInDenmark And THAT is how you church.
===
@TiredFairy I saw this in a theatre with my best friend - we honestly expected it to be really bad, and were HUGELY pleased to be very, very wrong.
===
@OregonRolledA20 I'm perversely glad he got kicked - no gaming is better than bad gaming, and that right there was some bad gaming.
===
I'm not even a little bit Asian American, but, yeah, y'all belong here. https://t.co/uDLxtAO6Ci
===
@GSBCE1of4 @GailSimone Well, yeah, I'm just wondering if it's ACTUALLY Laura Palmer in there. Could be. It's Shudder, after all.
===
@SlacktivistFred Cognitive dissonance is a helluva drug.
===
@protectedstatic @ghweldon Agreed, but that doesn't mean he can't split the sub vote.
===
@willianpbusch "Misperceive," and yes. Unlike the skill in D&amp;D, sometimes you can perceive something, but not completely.
===
@KLoeffler @MLB @Braves So, to be clear, you're lying in a post in which you're accusing other people of lying? That seems ... unsatisfying.
===
@whyaredads STRONG Fozzy energy off this tweet. https://t.co/QlBOXb9Yyx
===
I had fun during my stream today! Thank you @NoxVtuber for the raid. Again thank you moochi much for the support and donations, berries! 💜💜
===
@NoxVtuber Yes it is😍
===
@NoxVtuber It's technically the week so, this is what I am proud of (: Just finished last minute adjustments to today https://t.co/JMvTDjGgPJ
===
@NoxVtuber Afternoon Lilith! Hope you're having a fantastic friday (: I plan on playing outriders a bunch this weekend
===
@NoxVtuber I'm enjoying it a lot, except when a captain shows up because I usually end up dying a couple times xD
===
@NoxVtuber Good morning! Hope you have a wonderful day!

Try asking me again this weekend and I should hopefully have an answer :P
===
@mrcoaster1 @Hersheypark We had a fun day!
===
@macgregor63 So far, so good! Hope you have a great day, Ian.
===
Getting down to the nitty gritty with Clank! Legacy: Acquisitions Incorporated. Completed 9 games of the 11 game campaign. Fun story, cool surprises, and plenty of silliness along the way. Great game. https://t.co/0S5Kd3y4Di
===
@MrsCoaster1 thinks she’s found a bell pepper inside a bell pepper. I think she found an alien egg sac, and the infestation/attack begins after midnight. https://t.co/Fc7tPtkvU2
===
@OnlineHyde Great choice. Now I want to see this.
===
@kathyk671 We never did that, but Country Bears was a hot attraction back then, and regularly had a line into Frontierland. Valid strategy. E raced a few times to make reservations for Diamond Horseshoe, cause you couldn’t do it 6 months in advance.
===
@levelbest @INTERCOT Ha! That sounds hilarious. I definitely appreciate the effort on something like that.
===
@NCSox @MLB @MLBTV This has always bothered me, too. Near DC, I regularly find myself blacked out of any games involving the Nats, Phillies, and Orioles. That killed a lot of the Red Sox and Marlins games I might have watched.
===
@OuterRimJim I remember that day so clearly. We were in shock in Miami.
===
Brace yourselves for the incoming terrible April Fools tweets and fake "Breaking News!" articles. There's a lot of terrible April Fools jokes out there among the rare gems.
===
@Mousesteps That’s about my style these days. Always look like I’m on vacation.
===
@TheScottVenture I've proposed doubling the number of days in the weekend, but no traction there yet
===
@AshleyLCarter1 Why is there a peanut butter dude to dip it in?? So odd.
===
Monday sure came back around awfully fast. A little too fast. https://t.co/qhVoNE8z0o
===
@ThemeParkBeer We didn’t think it could get more epic than this battle. So good.
===
@ThemeParkBeer Hehe.
Sarah fighting the good fight for the downtrodden beers.
I'm ok with letting the top 3 go.
===
@CarmenandBrian *Biked
===
@freedom_jams Time to go ride the monorail again
===
@CarmenandBrian Already booked 20 miles and found some missing video footage. Productive day already!
===
@BurghFinsFan He is one cool cat, that's for sure. Future looks bright.
===
Opening Day is upon us.
Probably. https://t.co/GA7LhQ3oyH
===
@TheDollyrots @kellydollyrot @luisdollyrot Happy anniversary!
===
The 3-day weekend has arrived! Let there be FUN! https://t.co/5BhKjyM4bq
===
@scottr021 That’s a good one. Need to get back there again.
===
@Disn3yDude Got mine a few months ago, and no issues. Still waiting for the other 2 in the house to get vaccinated. For me, second shot only resulted in being a little more fatigued the next day, but didn’t slow me down at all. No other symptoms.
===
Hehe - I actually want to see this. “Grohlfinger” would be quite the villain.
&gt;Dave Grohl to star as the villain in new James Bond movie https://t.co/vkazBAUwQk via @KerrangMagazine
===
@ParacosmTravel I like how you think. Zero losses.
===
@DSNDua25 It is a good game. Better than you might expect from an IP inspired game. Two phases of the game make it pretty immersive in the feel of the movie.
===
@scottr021 Cinnamon. Bread.
Lots of great new additions to Dollywood over the last 15 years though. Hit Lightning Racer early and often.
===
@BoardOfItReview @Thenerdshelves @JudieBrookhart @AEGMinions Between the art/components/theme/vibe, it works for us. We will see how things shake out after another 20 plays.
===
@ProfNarcoossee Hehe. Maybe one of those Hurricane wind theme park dryers will help? https://t.co/vhIVarUJFZ
===
@Disneydeb67 I'll usually get up early anyway, but at least I don't have to, and you are so right - no alarms!
===
@erik_niel @Hersheypark Gotta had over there soon, myself.
===
@elizhargrave Really awful people out there, and nobody should have to deal with it. Glad BGG is taking the no tolerance stand on responses like these.
===
@CarmenandBrian Too chilly for swimming, but looks like a beautiful day for some walking
===
@OuterRimJim @BlackstoneGrid Fascinating! Haven’t seen one of these before, but it’s a great idea.
===
@scottr021 Oh yeah. They’re pretty snug. So many good vibes at that park, in any case. I’m ready to go back myself.
===
@antwanstaley I remember your handle back then, as that’s when we started following each other.
===
@Thenerdshelves @JudieBrookhart @AEGMinions It's really fun. Is it perfect? No. It has some flaws, but we really enjoy playing it. Goes great with an Indiana Jones trilogy soundtrack (let's not discuss Crystal Skull).
===
@DUAs25 Working on it now!
===
@CarmenandBrian Awesome wildlife scenery
===
@jpalmiotti Bear on a shark. I can’t risk being judged by Jeff Goldblum while showering.
===
@Marvelman76 Holy crap, I had no idea Zack Snyder or James Gunn were involved. Probably time for me to watch it again!
===
@jpalmiotti Good mix. I listen to a lot of that stuff. I love seeing Marshall Crenshaw on there.
===
@Marvelman76 @mynerdvault I'm very envious that you've seen Belle &amp; Sebastian!
===
I am now fully vaccinated!
===
@azsweetheart013 @SenMarkKelly I struggle with moving to a blue state...or staying in FL and trying to turn it blue.
===
@IndieWire I find more reasons to like @HamillHimself everyday.
===
@AmandaRantsAlot Congrats! You may have a sore arm later but it's so worth it! I'm getting my second dose on Thursday. Trying to gear myself up for the possible side effects.
===
@jamesoneill83 @GailSimone Luke Skywalker was my favorite Thundercat.
===
@ronmarz Sorry man...that's a bummer.
===
@thefemtrooper That commercial used to play a lot during Orioles games. It gets stuck in my head.
===
@Marvelman76 I love the cover to issue 149.
===
@Marvelman76 Oh man, I preordered the Predator omnibus. Brings back so many memories!
===
@ronmarz Opening Day has been rained out for the O's/Sox. Womp womp.
===
@ronmarz I hope they get it done. It could be worse. They could be trying to blow a huge amount of money on Chris Davis while letting Manny Machado get away. It's tough being an O's fan.
===
@azsweetheart013 Tico says hello! https://t.co/T3moxXf8jG
===
@CTropes Holy crap....this makes me feel old.
===
My daughter: Daddy, what's that terrible smell?
Me: That's the paper mill.
Daughter: ...
Me: ...
Daughter: None of my paper ever smelled like that!
===
@GailSimone Those X-Men don't look 'Giant Size' to me. They look regular sized.
===
@jpalmiotti I didn't feel the shot at all. Definitely had a sore arm later though. Congrats on getting your first dose!
===
@ronmarz The Mets have the best opening day winning percentage of all time. The O's aren't far behind! https://t.co/yiT2RUykFq
===
The second dose of Moderna has given me a 101.2 degree fever. So worth it though.
===
@Marvelman76 My wife LOVES Power Pack!
===
@StevieVanZandt I’ll be there in 2022 to provide drinks and snacks. Some law offices are offering to represent those arrested for free.
===
@ronmarz @MitchGerads @LindseyGrahamSC Possibly the only true thing he's ever said.
===
@Marvelman76 I'm tempted to pick up the upcoming Aliens omnibus. I liked some of those old Dark Horse stories. Marvel does a good job with their omnibus collections.
===
@Mattthewwwww I’m happy some like it. I’m not a huge fan. That codpiece kind of..um..sticks out, doesn’t it?
===
@jpalmiotti Mother******. Damn it, I was getting excited. I hate this day. 🤣
===
@GailSimone My favorite original X-Men are Betty &amp; Veronica.
===
Is it ok to fart next to non mask wearers in stores? Asking for a friend.
===
@mmpadellan Hard to argue with those choices.
===
@GailSimone Oooh...my favorite X-Men cartoon is He-Man.
===
@rachel_berc I live in a household with my wife and two grown daughters. You won't find me criticizing.
===
@rachel_berc I've never understood why a natural part of life is so taboo.
===
@azsweetheart013 Tampa Bay? Yeah..me too, honestly. I want to move AWAY from DeSantis (I already live in FL).
===
@Marvelman76 All nice picks! I'm very interested to know if Alien is any good. Nice cover!
===
@AaronMeyers I'm very envious.
===
@azsweetheart013 @EthicalGurl Now that I permanently work from home (the only good thing to come out of the pandemic), we're trying to decide where to live. AZ, CO, ME, NoVA (where I'm from) and the Tampa Bay area are all in play.
===
@JMDeMatteis I had no idea you had written Conan. Very cool!
===
@CTropes I hope you get better soon. This is terrifying.
===
@sckarr1 I needed that laugh!
===
@johnblueriggs @postcereals That picture just gave me diabetes. It looks delicious though.
===
@LiamRSharp @StazJohnson Holy crap! This stuff is fantastic!
===
@Kimota1977 Only ten cents over cover, nice!
===
@John_Fogerty @MLB Baltimore Orioles!

@Shiisiln One of my friends has these!!! They are gorgeous!
===
Y’all I know most people did this fucking years and years ago, but —

I’m on a lease! For an apartment! I’m not just squatting, there is a legal document that I am renting this apartment! I’m really excited and proud of myself 🥰
===
Aight y’all, my quarterly period has arrived, I am incredibly horny for tender emotional connection, if you don’t get an “I miss you” text from me in the next five days it’s because even though I am yearning for you I also think everybody I have ever cared about hates me
===
@ChaoticGoodInn You’re the love of my life, I’m always horny for your tender emotional connection
===
Oh my goddd. Everything about this headline sucks. He murdered his wife and kids because he FUCKING FELT LIKE IT, the woman he was fucking is not responsible for that, and also, fuck this picture they always fucking use. Pull out the mugshot, you fucking cowards. https://t.co/oPEoOoCgPh
===
(If you’re wondering if this tweet is about you the answer is yes)
===
@SuperSpaceQueer Love that for you though 😂
===
@sams_takeover @ChaoticGoodInn I wonder if the long hair is holding you back?? I twist mine a lot which is easier bc of the length

@froggyvoid Fuck yeah!! If you don’t mind me asking, do you have a go-to brand for hair color? I’m new to doing it at home and trying to decide what I should buy that won’t turn my apartment shower blue lmao
===
@MeadraJim Melted, usually on some form of wheat slab.

Yeah the Twitter OGs know. After I started covering the Dolphins full time in 2014, I changed it to what it is now. But those were fun times https://t.co/I1RBjsP7E3

@NikBounty Hmm... when I think of those names the vibe you give me is someone I can trust, a friend that I can talk to, a cool personality, and a person that I enjoy talking to and see grow

@NikBounty @HoneyDewVT This is so cute I am going to sob
===
@HoneyDewVT @NikBounty I’m just glad you dont know
===
@HoneyDewVT @NikBounty I’m afraid because of other posts with monster drink means something else. Very wholesome still , love the cozy feel ❤️
===
@MeadraJim @ghweldon Kermit's clearly vers.
===
@NikBounty How did you know!!!
===
@NikBounty Baby don't hurt me don't hurt me no more
===
@NikBounty It was when you were Azzy. I saw your sunglasses and immediately thought "this is one cool MFer and there's no way they'll interact with me".

Then we became mutuals.
===
@NoxVtuber Okay... the stars seem to be asking you for a horoscope reading instead, since you have seniority. That's a bit strange...
===
@NikBounty I think it was Nik. Mustve been early March? Or maybe even before that, but rat brain memory. 😰 I followed you though cuz I think you're funny and enjoy seeing your tweets !
===
@mrcoaster1 The weekend zoomed by in a Flash

@mrcoaster1 Enjoy your weekend of fun.

@NikBounty I don’t even remember what you were called back then

@NikBounty time to use the best strat https://t.co/6ivW1Zuawr

@NieniesRevenge I used manic panic and it definitely turned my shower blue lol! but for the green I used Good Dye Young which was great and didn’t stain anything!

SIR IT IS 3:11 A.M. IN THE MORNING AT THIS WENDY’S https://t.co/wtyaUH2XrF
===
@N7IRL Gah lol
===
@N7IRL Nah, the near-death experience was actually your first moment of life, and all your previous memories were implanted at they moment, which was also the beginning of the entire universe, populated by one single being.
===
@N7IRL So far I'm pretty disappointed ngl
===
@N7IRL @arthur_affect As a Californian I get a lot of use out of "my dude," which comes at all this from the other direction? That is, extreme casualness being used to mask exasperation.
===
@nishikiyaama AAAHGGHGHHG THANK YOU SO MUCH RUBY!!!
===
@NikBounty u good bro
===
@NikBounty Nik you’re way too cool lol
===
@NikBounty Nik my birthday is literally tomorrow I’ve tweeted about it multiple times 😔😔

@NikBounty I’ve posted it on discord a bunch too 😔😔😔😔😔

I’m teasing obviously, but still
===
@NikBounty I love u too homie

@NikBounty I’m still gonna poke fun at you!

@michelegiletv @N7IRL @CBSLA Flooding a society with guns has horrible consequences and is a policy choice 💀💀💀💀

@mrcoaster1 I have done Storm Chaser at Kentucky Kingdom, but my last ride was almost 4 years ago.

@mrcoaster1 Thank you! I'm hoping I fit 😂😂! RMC's can be a real b to big people. 😂😂
===
@NikBounty Dude he can imitate George Lopez perfectly , it’s close enough
===
@NikBounty Oh damn nice
===
@NikBounty George Lopez?
===
@NikBounty What is?
===
@NikBounty Never had it before
===
@NikBounty The only reason it caught my eye is because I’m fat
===
No way @Melonminty_ https://t.co/Ijn770BkMK https://t.co/oPvIgwuadA
===
@NoxVtuber Oh no you’re hot https://t.co/Vg46txuXCM
===
@NoxVtuber Exactly. This person has never mentioned anything in my server, only directs flirty or thirsty comments at me on stream... like this act REALLY makes me feel like I understand their intentions now.
===
@NoxVtuber Ooooh that does sound like a lot of fun! I hope you enjoy it!
===
@MuppetArmy76 Your wife has incredibly good taste my friend!
===
@MuppetArmy76 Nice! Some good comics collected in that I’m sure!
===
@MuppetArmy76 Yeah I have the first 4-5 trades of Dark Horse Aliens that I got back in the day, Predator too! Really liked them.
===
@MuppetArmy76 It was a pretty good read and I’m interested to see where it’s heading.
===
@MuppetArmy76 @mynerdvault Around 2000 I think. They were awesome!
===
@MuppetArmy76 Yeah me too, love a good reflected image cover!
===
@aicandii @NoxVtuber protecc me from the boolis🥺💜👉🏻👈🏻 nyaa~
===
@NoxVtuber @aicandii thankies nox💜
===
@MeadraJim You know I did.
===
@NepSwirlRedux @N7IRL I mean no, the murder itself is the worst part. But he should *already be doing time* but instead we have this bullshit trying to publicaly character-assassinate a good man.
===
@NepSwirlRedux @N7IRL I think what bothers me the most about this giving trial is that he was ready to plead guilty from the get-go because he *knew* what he did was murder, but somehow William Barr thought 'nah.'
===
@MeadraJim @SlacktivistFred Generally it isn't very nice to make fun of people for things they can't help...

But in ol' Benny's case, he would do nothing but benefit from relaxing his standards for masculinity.
===
@mrcoaster1 My mom LOVED Country Bears and didn’t want to miss it! That and Pirates were our must-do’s. I remember eating at Crystal Palace a couple of times. I don’t think we did Diamond Horseshoe, darn it!
===
@Trailer_Travels @mrcoaster1 @INTERCOT Yes they were. 🤣
===
@mrcoaster1 On @INTERCOT we once broke a story that Disney had genetically engineered monkey’s for animal kingdom to have Mickey Mouse type ears. I did a killer photoshop job. Hook line &amp; sinker - people were so upset before they realized what day it was. And back then, no social to spoil.
===
@levelbest @mrcoaster1 @INTERCOT Those were the days, John 😂
===
@MuppetArmy76 Yeah, its quite the eye catcher lmao
===
@NoxVtuber THAT!!!! THAT RIGHT THERE!!!!!! "Resources are WIDELY available". THIS is the thing that blows my mind on tech things. Especially simple ones, where it honestly takes longer to call in to a tech line to find out why it doesn't work then for you to google why it isn't working.
===
@NoxVtuber I do not understand this mindset. I got my first car, I learned to change the oil/tires myself on it and do the basic maintenece to keep it running. I don't understand the logic behind "I just use it, idk anything about it" kinda people.
===
I finally had some free time to draw this morning so I present to you @/NikBounty ☺️ I’m experimenting with styles and I’m vibing with this one! #bountyarts https://t.co/pyd7r1VQyQ
===
@NoxVtuber Please eat for me!
===
@sjjphd @N7IRL Isn’t this just a question of form over function? I get that for clarity’s sake I ought to choose the efficient route. But what about he entertainment and creative value of the English language? What about play? What about poetry?  What about rhythm and meter?
===
@NoxVtuber What is on anime night?
===
@NoxVtuber You slept ok?
===
@mrcoaster1 What's the difficulty level in terms of learning how to play?
===
@N7IRL Sometimes you look at a tweet and wish you’d thought of it first because damn, that’s good. 🔥
===
@NieniesRevenge This picture is fucking perfect
===
@NiaPsakasTits @GailSimone Thank you! 
X-Men teams are confusing!
===
@N7IRL I was going to say that he's played by Laurence Fishburne, but then he would look like Bill Foster.
===
@BootlegGirl @N7IRL But his cloned daughter Lil Nas X-23 has a small following.
===
@N7IRL In my head canon, he'll always be a Brett Easton Ellis character. Not a lead or even support, mind you, but more of a walk-on who reinforces the smarmy vacuity of the book's milieu.
===
@NikBounty Then collab with skinny people
===
@NikBounty As an Asian, I don't think we get that fourth perk
===
@NikBounty I simp for HoloStaff Gen 1: YAGOO, A-Chan, T-Chan, Enma, Jenma, and J-Chad
===
@NikBounty Everyone
===
@N7IRL Almost as if there's some kind of relationship between the two things.
===
@N7IRL Wilhuff.
===
@treydayway @N7IRL All the more telling because Satan is clearly of age

@CharlesJohnDaw2 @GailSimone Also it depends on the continuity. In at least one timeline, Firestar was an early member. In most, she wasn't an X-Man at all until the school hired her as an adult.

@FieldOfInquiry @GailSimone Religious Nightcrawler is some kind of sin.
I don't mean having him be practising. I mean having him take holy orders.
Kurt is a sex symbol, &amp; they should have stuck with that.
===
@GailSimone That's 'cos you have taste.

(And yeah, it took me a couple to remember there was a team before his, lol)
===
@CharlesJohnDaw2 @GailSimone OK, it's a long list, but this will do for a start:

1st team: Prof X, Cyke, Jeannie, Iceman, Beast, Angel, Mimic (rip), Havok, Polaris

2nd team: Cyke again, Thunderbird (rip), Banshee, Logan, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Storm

Then it kind of changed one by one...

@NikBounty ahh that makes more sense
still recommend terror's stream because he's one of the best rozzis in NA

@NikBounty I really can't believe this actually is a thing that people just fail to realise

@MeadraJim But can you perceive something completely? Asking in D&amp;D terms: can you actually have an epic fail/epic success in the roll? Or are we just in the between?

@N7IRL Lil Nas X-2 wasn’t nearly as popular

@ChicagoMSTie @N7IRL I am in lesbians with this tweet.

Also, at what stage of the Lil Nas Plus program did the government graft the adamantium to his bones? Carrying that around is no doubt how he got so fit.

@WitchRubyLove @NoxVtuber I still don't see a single smidge of a problem! Purple is a really fun color to wear though.

@NoxVtuber Oh very fair, its tough to make sure you're ready for everything. I have faith in you though, you can do it!

@MuppetArmy76 Me neither

@MuppetArmy76 Thank you! I have to say, like 99% of the men that follow me are fine with it, there's always one person though

@NieniesRevenge People do this at their own pace, I dont think your behind at all. Congrats! May your landlords respect you and your privacy. Huzzah for next steps!!!
===
@mrcoaster1 @Thenerdshelves @JudieBrookhart @AEGMinions Agree with this! I do love the game but it is flawed and personally we don’t quite understand all the hype...but it is a very good game!
===
@NikBounty Congrats!!
===
@N7IRL That seems absolutely correct. There chatter at the time he stole credit on the Snowden story from a woman he worked with, who's name I sadly don't remember. And somehow he and Taibbi have moved on to Russia defenders and " right wing curious" darlings of the libertarian right.
