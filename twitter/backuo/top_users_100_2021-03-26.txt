You left out the homework part. Probably because I refuse to help you with it anymore, huh?

@RPat360 @IndieWire Alot of audience are happy. Check rotten-tomatoes.

I dont know if you are a marvel fan or not but regardless do you also say the same standard to Marvel films or any film? Maybe some films have high ratings because they viewers were already fans of those films. Absurd.
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire Twitter w/ a million tweets about #RestoretheSnyderVerese is working perfectly well. 

I don’t know how they are bullied if they are only for money. Maybe they saw profit in allowing snyder cut.

If studio can be bullied then, they can be bullied again for #RestoretheSnyderVerese
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire That is better if you don’t have a horse in the race.
I just find the reasoning absurd that people are happy beacuse they were already fans. Fans are happy, not doubt. But non-fans can be happy too with the film.
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire It easy to call anyone toxic in order to dismiss others.

Fanbase had been attacked  by  criticism.  If we will play that game of whose is toxic, just ask yourself who do you think is more intolerant. 

Your anti-snyder position show that you can’t get along with others
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire Lets see what would happen. Those who pushed the Snyder Cut survived the criticism and antagonism that were directed to them for three years. 

They survived the toxicity of anti-Snyder.
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire Okey, great. I wish WB good look. let them earn money while dissing the demand of audiences.
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire I assume you hate zack snyders cut or any of his films. Why?
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire There you go, you just revealed that you are annoyed, which I can sense why you can’t tolerate another film from snyder. 

Maybe you and the group that you represent are annoyed, but that do not pertain to the whole twitter.

We often forget that “we live in a society.”
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire And maybe avengers too. hahaha
It was by design creating a cinematic universe.
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire hahaha, right. Movies are made to create for their particular market.

you could say the same to any other movies with a sequel.
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire please acount all other streaming platforms.

i think the better approach is to wait and see
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire Disregarding 1M tweets is a poor insight for marketing.
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire yeah business to make money and not friends.

well, they should try to antagonize their viewers more often. great marketing idea.
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire you represent the tired while the 1M tweets and counting are the vibrant members of twitter.
===
@RPat360 @IndieWire I don’t get your logic here.
For the snyder cut, BvS $ MoS required viewing.
But won’t u allow same standard 2 other films.

Bourne movies need to be watched in sequence to understand final installment.
God Father 1 introduced Corleone family...

@socialcrumbs @IndieWire They hoped to make a profit by getting subscribers for HBO Max, but it was a gamble. 

They were bullied by endless tweets and threats. The head of WB said so on Monday. 

They're done being bullied. She made that clear. They learned that it's not worth it in the long run.
===
@socialcrumbs @IndieWire A happy audience doesn't mean an automatic sequel. It's about money. There aren't enough of you that are happy enough to pay money to see another installment. 

I'm not a Marvel or DC fan. I don't have a horse in this race. I don't care.
===
@socialcrumbs @IndieWire You represent a fanbase that has been labled "toxic" by a major studio. 

If you think that's vibrant, think again.
===
@socialcrumbs @IndieWire If you never saw Man of Steele or BvS, you would have no idea what was going on in Justice League. There is no background, you don't even know who the characters are. It was made just for fans, Snyder didn't even try to get new fans. I can say this because I didn't watch those.
===
@socialcrumbs @IndieWire Yeah, I lost patience a long time ago with a fanbase that tried to bully a studio with their entitlement. So did WB, it turns out. 

Trust me, all of Twitter is tired of you guys. Sarnoff called you "toxic." Get a clue.

@thewilsonwong @IndieWire Very confident he’ll make a good Batman but I also think Affleck was great. And Bale. I think comparisons are unnecessary because they’re different takes on the character. Very curious to see how he’s handled in the new Justice League. Watching it this weekend.
