power bottoms &amp; service tops are a thing for a reason! &amp; while i do enjoy more controlling flavors of service tops (ie being Bossy abt their determination to give their partner pleasure), that’s far from default? bc service top is usually in reference to a submissive role!!
===
without downloading any new pictures, show me your creative process in one image https://t.co/dNG3EZiT46 https://t.co/7Ha3Klr7Nu
===
imagine getting sued bc ur legally a top but u decided u wanted to get railed &amp; u didn’t feel like going to the Sex DMV for a one-time thing and omg now ur not allowed in the clubs bc u Didn’t Follow The Rules i’m YELLING—
===
this should really go without saying but i am an 18+ account so if ur not 18 do not. simply don’t.
===
@ariskamalt cat it’s very important to me u know that it took me a While to realize “botdom” was combining bottom &amp; dom and not a play on robot and bottom &amp; also i am Loving everything u say abt sportsball au
===
@lwjtiddiesucker do… do ppl really think that topping=domination and bottoming=submission? do i need to tell them that service top is, generally speaking, a submissive top????? what is hAPPening
===
quick disclaimer: all my info regarding things like service topping come from personal experience &amp; research and are by no means universally true. service tops *can* be doms, but ime it’s far less common
===
that said the movie’s a classic for a reason, namely that there’s a lot of technical prowess &amp; showmanship involved, &amp; that also means that a Lot of the content is extremely dated, which is unfortunate for a film so omnipresent in the genre now
===
ftr my temp w/oral thermometer was like. 96. on the day that i had a 102 fever. (it was also freezing as fuck outside.) so unfortunately i may be getting fevers more often than i thought
===
is ot a bad idea to watch psycho (1960) at 3 am yes/yes
===
like ik it’s a scary movie w/lots of footroom in the fantastic but i ALSO know i’m going to be frothing at the lips abt the, ah, decision to represent multiple personalities like That
===
top/bottom discourse satire where legally u have to register a Personality Change whenever u want to switch things up &amp; that means u have a sexy DMV that’s not sexy in the least, bc Bureaucracy Sucks Ass, But Not Like That
===
@vivipgri right??? like apparently the forehead one is... the Actual Worst which is certainly interesting. i’ll have to tey using the forehead thermometer w/my ear tho!! will probably be cheaper in the long run
===
@vivipgri the way we use modal words tends to be highly intuitive, so i’d hazard a guess that yeah, yall just know
===
@lillith78x ofc!! lmk if u have any questions ☺️
===
@CinamonPancakes truly 😩
===
@lwjtiddiesucker this hurts me on a spiritual level
===
SCREAMING my professor was like "QUESTION—" the very same SECOND i left the zoom call i'm 💀
===
and even top/bottom isn’t an ironclad thing? like i’m far from vers (i dislike the vulnerability of bottoming) but if i trust my partner enough i’m 100% down to clown!
===
and this has gotten a little TMI but!!!!! in essence! these aren’t “personality traits” they’re literally just preferences!! and sometimes ppl behave differently when they want smth different!! i’m going to have a different affect when i’m topping than when i’m bottoming!
===
this just in: AJ has thoughts abt TB discourse and those thoughts come down to “talk to real gay ppl with actual gay experience and get ur head out ur ass”
===
&amp; b) that alters are usually VERY subtle, as DID is a highly advanced coping/defensive mechanism…
===
“imagine getting sued bc ur legally a top” is one hell of a phrase. i’ve officially peaked. i’ll never write anything better than this https://t.co/ayyn1Fbgzg
===
this is coming from me, ur friendly local service top, who would Actually Combust if i was expected to dom but can and will [REDACTED] w/my gratification coming in the form of my partner’s pleasure! if they boss me around then all the better!!
===
@lwjtiddiesucker truly 😔 imagine getting so caught up in ur own preferences for a character’s sexual preferences that u don’t realize bottoms can also be controlling in bed… almost like… sexual preferences lie on a spectrum………
===
@lillith78x aha yeah, being around ppl w/similar experiences/likes/etc is really helpful for figuring things out! lots of ppl weigh in here on what service topping means: https://t.co/e5wfAC0RR4 (&amp; cesspool or no, reddit is handy for getting community feedback on things like this!)
===
anyway the fact that Mother &amp; Norman are treated as 2 separate entities really hammers in the fact that they had some idea of how DID worked (including the connection to childhood sexual trauma) but failed to understand that a) it’s the systems who r at the most risk
===
ok no but really: dom/sub &amp; top/bottom are NOT the same thing!!! &amp; dom/sub isn’t an inherent part of every relationship, but an added feature based on the characters’ kinks and interests https://t.co/sjgJXZyaef
===
me: yeah i overheat a lot

doc: have u considered that these r fevers

me: the oral &amp; forehead thermometers never go above 99 :/

doc: Use The Ear Thermometer, For Crying Out Loud
===
even saying that much risks being a major spoiler so uhhhhhh apoilers for a *counts on fingers* 60 year old movie ig?
===
also to be clear when i say “personality change” i don’t mean that literally (DID is a very real thing that does not deserve to be further mocked) i mean like. along with a gender designator on ur ID u also have T or B on ur ID bc ur preferences r legally binding
===
@CinamonPancakes haaaaa yeah 🙃 my body is distinctly broken &amp; apparently i should only trust ear &amp; *shudders* rectal thermometers now
===
@lillith78x @vivipgri good to know!! thank you
===
all that said i really am just having fun and games like is it wild ppl think this? yes. do i care? absolutely not &lt;3
===
@melancholyto hhhhh yeah it’s all fun and games til u realize ur body is a deathtrap LMAO
===
i’d put in a request for the terrible sex DMV in the kinkmeme but it is in response to discourse so alas i cannot. that said: please. please make fun of the inanity, i’m begging u
===
@ariskamalt i'm so glad bc Yes, the layers to it are *chef kiss* phenomenal
===
anyway, i think u could do interesting things w/thoughtful &amp; empathetic approach to DID (ie NOT vilifying it), but so few ppl r willing to put in the work to achieve the requisite understanding to execute such a thing, which is deeply unfortunate
===
@lanerjie is this the idea sneaking up on me or me lurking on ao3 seconds before publishing the fic? https://t.co/GYaW55EES3
===
@marcusleroux @hhesterm The memo clearly says that part of their grievance wasn't just that the data was outdated, but that was, in their view, selectively favorable.
===
@marcusleroux @hhesterm DSMB problem was AZ presented 5wk old data (Feb 17) when more recent figures would have given a slightly lower %. Can't see anywhere in the Pfizer release that suggests a similar gap? 1st Pfizer release you posted came Nov 9 &amp; cites data accurate to Nov 8; 2nd is Nov 18 / Nov 13.
===
"COVAX is in talks with the Government of India with a view to ensuring deliveries as quickly as possible."
===

===
Dust beginning to settle from latest storm to hit AstraZeneca. Lots of blame to go around, but again little dent in evidence this is anything other than a safe, effective vaccine.

https://t.co/RJpYNkAuHp
===
This is a good explainer, making clear the point that the US/UK and the EU have fundamentally different approaches: the latter threatening to stop vaccine exports, the former never planning to do so in the first place. https://t.co/bGRHacErQM
===
NEW: COVAX partner Gavi says in a statement that COVAX "will face delays following a setback in securing export licenses for further doses of Covid-19 vaccines produced by the Serum Institute of India (SII) expected to be shipped in March and April"
===
Vaccine procurement: Is there any other field understood to hold so much public interest, but so little is actually known in terms of details? Fates of nations riding on secretive contracts &amp; vague statements, w experts left to read between the lines for what's actually going on.
===
@hhesterm @marcusleroux Right. A brief press release posted at midnight to the bowels of the NIH website. But if the DSMB writes you a letter explicitly warning you against presenting the figures in a certain way... And again no public record of this happening with any of the other drugmakers.
===
@marcusleroux @hhesterm What the DSMB warned AZ in its memo was that for this drugmaker the opposite was true: the newer figures were slightly less positive, explicitly warning it against using the older ones.
===
@marcusleroux @hhesterm Certainly seems there were more than 94 cases that for some reason weren't included in "the evaluable case count" on Nov. 9. And agree analyzing needs a specialist eye. But perhaps key: 2nd Pfizer PR saw headline % rise, so if anything delay would (v slightly) hurt not burnish.
===
Gavi asked for its comment to be updated: Says delays "are due to the increased demand of Covid-19 vaccines in India. SII has pledged that, alongside supplying India, it will prioritize the COVAX multilateral solution for equitable distribution."
===
@marcusleroux @hhesterm Is there any evidence Pfizer's press releases referred to data already 5 weeks old? Seems to me this is more a case of the DSMB slapping AZ's wrist for doing science by press release (which everyone does) and muddying the numbers, rather than any serious concerns re efficacy.

@ireneinterlude @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 Possibility yeah, certain no
===
@ireneinterlude @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 Again there is no proof they seen eachother lol. They were at the same match okay?? Matches are big
===
@ireneinterlude @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 and there is no proof they seen eachother lol. Ive been in the same town as niall are me and him dating now??
===
@ireneinterlude @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 like i said mabey they seen eachother across the room but actually spoke??
===
@ireneinterlude @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 Never said it is hard to interact with ex-bandmates but there is no proof is what im saying
===
@adoreher8 @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 So it isn't a certainty that they didn't speak at all either
===
@allthelovenora @adoreher8 @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 Yes but she was saying that they didn't see each other for 5 years I didn't say anything about the baby😀
===
@adoreher8 @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 Why not?? It's not that hard interact with one of your ex bandmates
===
@adoreher8 @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 Yes right so in your opinion two ex bandmates that are at the same match, so in the same place and in the same room not necessarily saw each other? They had to be blind then😀😀 and being the same town and being in the same room is kinda different
===
@adoreher8 @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 Yes in the same room and literally they posted both about it...
===
@adoreher8 @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 So you don't have a valid argument to prove me I could be wrong by saying this ok😀
===
@adoreher8 @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 This could be a possibility??
===
@adoreher8 @allthelovenora @fearlesssbot @T0MM0SPAYN0 They were at the same match in February 2020😀
===
@alcego_writes ammdjd the thought also occured to me but that just made it better

@alcego_writes I definitely will! I’m finally getting to understand myself a little better. This bird app &amp; this fandom has been so helpful!
===
@vivipgri @alcego_writes Yes, thermal scanners are NOT accurate. Pls get the ear or mouth one. Pls do not eat or drink anything 5 min before checking your temp &amp; environment can definitely affect it. The most accurate way to get your temp is actually rectal.

@alcego_writes I am learning so much! Thanks! 😊

@akshitsoni_ @cbseindia29 @DrRPNishank @EduMinOfIndia @inBritish @CambridgeInt @AlphaPlusCoUk @PIB_India @PTI_News @AkashvaniAIR @DDNewslive You are the eternal optimist !
===
@agayhomosexual "Literally everything"
Well, except smart, apparently.
===
@AlexanderSmith @hhesterm I don't think that's a like-for-like comparison - presumably Pfizer is referring to fully validated and analysis cases. Because the Nov 18 Pfizer release had 170 cases and Nov 9 only 94.
===
@AlexanderSmith @hhesterm Yes and the 69-74% range was off the mark. Communication between the panel and the company was obviously sub-optimal!
===
@AlexanderSmith @hhesterm yeah, something has clearly gone seriously wrong somewhere - at the very least with communicating with the DSMB.
===
@AlexanderSmith @hhesterm no evidence that I'm aware of but other things being equal Pfizer may have used *older* evidence. I'd be interested in a specialist view!
AZ interim: 141 cases/190 cases 
Pfizer interim: 94 cases/170 cases
===
@AlexanderSmith @hhesterm yeah, which I think is where the validated/unvalidated cases comes in. The DSMB surely should have been made aware of the latest case data. That the efficacy went up rather than down is rather beside the point if the concern is the accuracy of data.
===
@AgentSeska Love ya, Dee! 😘
===
@agayhomosexual hold up...
is this real?
===
@cbseindia29 @DrRPNishank @EduMinOfIndia @inBritish @CambridgeInt @AlphaPlusCoUk @PIB_India @PTI_News @AkashvaniAIR @DDNewslive @malpani Sir,Look at this🤭.
No collaboration only competition
===
@AgentSeska we all love you 🙂
===
@AgentSeska Ahh. All the pet hair. Looks just like home lol.
===
@AlexanderSmith @marcusleroux I think it was this precarious line: too unacceptable not to get slapped, but not actually putting in doubt efficacy. In normal times it would not have annoyed anyone very much. But these are not normal time.
===
@alcego_writes god aint that a mood 🤝
===
@agayhomosexual WHAT IS THIS

@AgentSeska Definitely no!
