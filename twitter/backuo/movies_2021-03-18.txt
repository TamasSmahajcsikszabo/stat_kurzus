Snyder Cut is obviously gonna be a better movie but... Snyder had control over Batman vs Superman too so... But then again they did force him to put all that setup for Justice League to try andcatch up to Marvel... But then again MoS was a piece of shit and that one was fully his https://t.co/7igjnf0qTW

@digitalspy Snyderscut is like watching Lord of the Rings two towers, Extended edition.... they cut all the best scenes out and added them in later? Which to me shouldn’t of happened. Why do movie companies spend millions on making a movie, and the cut out parts are the best parts of it?

It plays like a mini-series rather than a film, &amp; I'll be honest it could've been 6 hours and still felt too short. It is a whole new movie though, inconsistent, w/ poorly written dialogue. Action is stupendous &amp; casting is brilliant

@theSNYDERVERSE Don’t kill me people but I felt the movie felt short LOL. Like there was more in the scenes. Idk maybe it’s just that even the stuff Zack showed were different. Do wish the way superman landed in the lake house wasn’t changed tho. But makes sense he’s learning to fly again

@FBG_Gidz Got used to it as the movie went by

See...like, why are they doing this? There's never going to be a sequel to this...not in the way it is setting up. 
Putting Martian Manhunter in this is kind of cruel. 
This movie isn't bad. It's not great. But it is setting up something better...we'll never get.

@tatumtotter Yeah...trailers are another annoying thing. It should be a preview of a movie...It shouldn't have EVERY best scene and best line from the movie. What's the point of watching it when you've already seen the best parts? Weak movies tend to do this a lot.

@ImtheShrey Once per movie to emphasize a big moment, sure... but the thing about action scenes is that they're supposed to depict action, not provide an opportunity for a character to go off on a long, boring, expositional monologue in their head!

The Snyder Cut is ideal cinema. It takes up like 20% of my day, I have absolutely no clue what is happening, it's so fucking long it just occurs in the background while my brain fuzzes out, any time I glance at the screen it's a creature or a famous actor I know. God shit.

these are all comments on a post abt an asian elder being brutalized in broad daylight and having to fight off her attacker. it’s entertainment. it’s a kung fu movie. we’re nothing to you. we’re fictional. and all from people who clearly think they’re on the right side of this https://t.co/hMxkoe8uSs

@LivnDeadGrl87 I found out today that the movie started as an adaptation of Stephen King's story 'Trucks' (aka Maximum Overdrive) but they ran into some issues (rights? Money?) after location scouting and wrote a new script based on locations.

The movie also possibly sets up the Flash standalone film and shows what could have been the sequel OR the trilogy to Justice League if it wasn't scrapped off. The Knightmare sequence holds a lot of details to that opportunity, one that will never happen.

finished Batman v Superman (director's cut). easily the most interesting of the slew of superhero movies, but far from the most enjoyable. Snyder, just dumb enough that he tries to be smart with a superhero movie, created a genuinely fascinating movie that shouldn't exist. 3/5

Between the actress and the model, however, there would still be a surge and the two certainly need to confront each other well away from the spotlight. Their relationship, to date, still seems to be flawed even if fans are hoping for a happy ending and a reconciliation.

@VancityReynolds Don’t do it!!! Is with the same guy that did Deadpool, but is really far in quality as a movie and performance... You’ll have a low image of that man... Unless you watch Deadpool right away you finish, or at least The Proposal... You’re on your own man...

Even if this new cut of the film is better than Weadon's own which wouldn't be difficult, can we really say it's because of Snyder's ability as a director given that he has had a long time to digest all the criticism of JL &amp; has an advantage that Weadon did not have

A few things on #ZackSnydersJusticeLeague.  There were scenes from Josstice League that were odd to me that were in the #SnyderCut. The issue was Josstice League had little to no character build up and no references to the scenes to make sense in the 2017 JL movie.
===
What a perfect movie <U+0001F60D>
Each character have its story build up.

And glad I was alive to watch Darkseid on screen

And @ray8fisher  deserves the credit for building up the movie
