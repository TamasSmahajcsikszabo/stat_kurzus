Whether you're vaccinated or not:
-Please wear a mask.
-Wash/Sanitize your hands regularly.
-If you have to go outside maintain social distance.

You don't want to be a statistic, seeing those numbers on the news and knowing you're one of them hits you/loved ones differently.

@CherylGrainger4 @Statisco_uk @NickTriggle @chrischirp @CMO_England The masks reduce the production of droplets and spray that contain the virus. So clearly they reduce the spread.

The biggest problem I see is discarded masks polluting the environment, which is avoidable.

Here no one cares to wear a mask. People do not care to even wash hands or sanitise themselves. So obviously infection will spread. Simple logic.

@MaggieD58 @DerekRobinson2 @grantedjohn I think of it this way: Do I take a chance on catching Covid where I would probably suffer extreme distress and possibly die, or do I accept a vaccine which has a tiny chance of side effects but will keep me out of hospital if I catch Covid? I think I'll take the AZ if offered.
