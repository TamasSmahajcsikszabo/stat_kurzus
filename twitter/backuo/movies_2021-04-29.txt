@marcbernardin I’ve never seen a John Wayne movie. I love the western genre as a metaphor, but every clip I’ve seen, he’s a terrible actor, and more than one of his films are anti-Native American. Sorry not sorry, Duke.

@sarcasticKatt @yugiohtas The Nier and Persona series has some of the best damn music scores period. Better than even movie soundtracks.

Failing to land the genre kill shot.

@Lesb_Wolf_Pagan But we have two major companies with a monopoly on the genre, pumping out pro-military, pro-corporate, pro-fascist propaganda in an age when fascism is on the rise, and one of them has the director of the single most influential modern piece of fascist propaganda doing it.

@shadyasashade oh of course. I love imagining i’m in a spy movie. espionage is the best genre. also the sexy clothes. think minimalist hoe
===
action films rule cuz the genre is truly born from and indebted to cinema; can’t be replicated in any other medium. Thrills are a result of clever editing, staging within whatever frame allowed, smart coverage &amp; cinematography, and pure movie star power. Who cares about script

@Mishyana @BootlegGirl (To be fair, it's probably just that the found footage genre is extremely dated, and has never evolved. So every movie looks like it came out the same summer of '99 along with Blair Witch.
I'm just poking fun at Cloverfield cause I never got the hype.)

@revstacey Oh this is also true with me! Although it is generally not my favorite genre (at least not now, more when I was younger), I am FAR more likely to be into a book than a show or movie. I'm not sure why.

@clarkvalentine In a way, AD&amp;D 2nd ed was a bunch of subsystems to do a various things. The problem was there were tacked on rather than integrated with each other. A game of a bunch of mini-games to build on each other would be cool. May work for alt reality or theatre genre.

Apatow is right about the obvious point. That awards in general look past genre films, comedy included, for more "serious" pictures.

The less obvious point, where he's wrong, is when people receive wisdom that a movie is "great," they ignore the humor that does exist in it. https://t.co/5Makxq7Zm4

Yasuke feels like LeSean Thomas's love letter to not only the jidaigeki genre and Yasuke himself, but also Blackness and found family and every remixed history movie where the lead gets to be fantastical. It's Black Magic at it's FINEST, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

Idk what the general consensus on Marvel movies is, but must say they really achieved something unprecedented with MCU. We actually didn't suffer from the cursed 3rd movie syndrome in the superhero genre.

backstory between Lee Hyun ji &amp; Choi Se yeong into the movie! It could be even better. 🤷🏻‍♀️ In conclusion, Imma rate this, 7.5/10.

Between Morta Kombat and Shang-Chi it looks like Hollywood might be going on a little martial arts trip. As if I needed another childhood obsession relapse. Now I have to watch every movie available for streaming in the genre. Can’t get enough right now.

Rating:20+

I still think there should be a genre based rating next to reviews. Like the new Mortal Kombat movie is maybe a 7/10 for a movie, but easily 8.5/10 for a fighting video game based movie.

@MollyTheGoblin Though it's kind of hard to pin down MGS to one specific genre other than military (and stealth obviously)

MGS2 is a political thriller with denpa(?) elements and straight up has psychological horror, MGS3 is a Bond movie etc

@JeffWhitmire1 @kinky_horror @TheMutantFam Just heard back from my Dad: “ I have not seen one better of the horror genre. It held me in suspense the whole movie.

@sonnuya plagarism or copying, unless we all want to pay royalties to Gance, the person who put this sort of shot on mainstream cinema, or Hitchcock, who popularised it for the horror and thriller genre. Art inspires more art, that's just how it is.

The kind of thinking, reflection, and media consumption habits that are needed for a movie genre to fundamentally change in that way in just two decades really does show how fucked our current situation is in America, if not the rest of the world.

Whereas the X-Men/DC approach is to start with a certain genre and incorporate the superheroes. 

Neo western starring Wolverine, sci-fi epic with Superman, political thriller starring the Trinity, war movie with Wonder Woman, adventure fantasy starring Aquaman.

Blondie from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is probably the best chilled, calm protagonist ever written in a western genre movie. (IMO)

Brilliantly performed by Clint Eastwood. https://t.co/a8INV2tphX

@NoahHarald Especially to cross-pollinate genre. An action director will probably get more interesting inspiration for set pieces from Busby Berkeley musical numbers (Dames!) than whatever Netflix is burying this week.

@MrComplainerrrr @PsyIocke_ I’m not commenting on the quality of the movie, I’m saying that “it has the best cgi” is a categorically false statement.  Plenty of films have fantastic CGI that range from the Fantasy genre to science fiction that at least equate or are better than Sony exclusive Spidey films.

@KyodaiKino I think there's merit in terms like "kaiju-adjacent", but again, that only works if we consider "kaiju" as a genre rather than akin to "monster movie" as the "literal translation" argument implies. And defining "kaiju" as a genre is its own messy thread!

@dmoren Yeah, a big genre of old trade stories was detailing the travel plans of movie stars.

In many ways I think creating the next big music genre, producing epic new literature/cinema depicting a future built with ideas that aren't so libtard and cringe, teaching the kids how to not be f*gg*ts.. This is as vital as anything else, we need to demonstrate spiritual power.

@bestfilmeverpod @eventhescorepod Blair Witch Project wasn't a good movie but I did, for a while, give birth to the found footage genre and entertaining movies like Paranormal Activity which I love.

A slasher film awash in a pink color scheme; fast paced, for both the good and bad. The movie gets right down to business, but that pace also hampers plot and character development although what we end up with is sufficient for the genre.

Acting is generally good with the standouts being the titular Ranger and our ‘final-girl’. The practical effects are also good but none of the kills are really anything new for genre fans, however, they are all well done as is the entire movie.

It’s a fine movie with a cool cast and cool concept but it’s far from the scariest thing in the genre. Even the original, cheesy 1987 HELLRAISER is scarier.

@ARestlessForest Many people will see your movie because it's X genre, so that will be the framework for most of your action, but only within X genre will get stale.

How TF is Aliens two and a half hours long?! So grateful I'm on a movie podcast covering a genre whose average runtime is 90 minutes
===
Omega Man is a really cool classic dystopian 'Last Man on Earth' horror movie. There's some obvious parallels to 28DL. Most horror movies are cheap &amp; s-ck. Great horror movies explore extreme situations, archaic fears and they're not limited by 'reality'. I love the genre.
===
@TotalTimWright @scumbelievable @yyoo1 Prior to the superhero movie/show genre explosion did you like superhero comics or previous superhero movies?
===
@PiousKnob Naw you are absolutely right LOL. Horror can be chock-full of ideas and lessons and tbh, it's a dumb shame that the genre isn't respected more in the overall cinema craft. One would imagine a good goal of cinema is to wanna make people watch it again and horror perfects that imo
===
@sweetlullaby00 What kinda genre are you looking for? I love Sci-fi, so Star Wars, which has multiple movies and series associated. Firefly and it's associated movie Serenity. Clash of the Titans, The Odyssey. Braveheart, Midway, 1917.
===
@InnuendoStudios George pal's war of the worlds from 1953. I used to listen to the book on cassette as a really little kid like 4 and its why to this day my favorite movie genre is creature features. The movie was filmed the year my dad was born and almost 70 yrs later it still holds up

@KaylaAncrum Please please please write this. Heist is my favorite movie genre and I've been itching to read a good heist story 🥺

one genuinely tragic element of like, exclusively watching relatively minor genre films from 1970-2000 is i am constantly just consumed by animalistic horniness for ppl who haven't looked like they do in the movie for decades &amp; for whom like no modern equivalent exists https://t.co/Ee8KsawOU1
===
@KaijuNewsOutlet If one of the scarier kaiju like Hedorah, Biollante, or Destroyah show up, it should be a full on lovecraftian horror movie. 

Action thrillers have worked well for the Monsterverse, but expanding the genre possibilities could keep the universe from getting too stale.

New episode with @WriterStag breaking down maybe the most divisive ALIEN film, PROMETHEUS. Underrated? We definitely think so. This is a movie really going for something, that still delivers genre fun. Link in bio. #filmpodcast #ridleyscott #michaelfassbender https://t.co/X8kCg04c4Z

spy/assassin au - ur favourite movie genre is probably comedic action like marvel n shit, u also probably WANT to look/be badass but ur literally just rlly fucking kind LOLL.

Big wish, their chemistry will continue to big screen, with the social issues or different genre movie.

To clarify: I don't have a genre that is a good go-to for me. And I'm not a snob who likes only high-end things (I'm more likely to watch Kentucky Fried Movie over anything nominated for an Oscar this year), I just like what I like.
===
@FelagiRich is this movie good? What genre?

A midnight show genre flick from a festival I can’t remember from 2014 for a movie that didn’t get distribution till 2017 and no one of my genre friends has rated higher than a 3? I’m out.

There's an actress of some renown in the horror/sci-fi genre who did this for (at least) one of the movies in her biggest franchise and it was legitimately more unsettling than the monsters in it. Especially since it's not even necessary. Seen her in person. Looks great. https://t.co/xVgIEaf8YA

@TommyDoyle47 Good horror movie? Yes. But it's not even the best horror movie directed by John Carpenter, to say nothing of the genre as a whole. https://t.co/YpbSf9Lq2w

@UberFacts Early Russian silent films are my favorite movie genre

@thecartooncrave The super hero genre is victim of style over substance.
I have never seen a single good super hero movie.

Playing DEE in the table read is the one and only Mo Moshaty. @MoMoshaty  She's an actor, producer, author  &amp; multi-genre screenwriter with a definite love of horror.

Today's coffee break ☕ movie is Scary Stories. I grew up on the book &amp; it was the start of my love affair w/ the horror genre. I've been nervous to watch this movie bc of how important the source material is to me, but it's streaming on Showtime so I guess I'll give it a try. https://t.co/HhWLaFx9sV

@JamaicanMaroonX @andreastarver Not only that they did this because 1.the actress was excellent for the role 2. They just wanted a black female on the scene why not Jade no one knows 3. And black characters are very rare in the pop culture and gaming genre
And y’all wasn’t doing this with Will smith as deadshot

@nytimestheater I'd say it is a genre now.
===
I think "horror" as a genre can be tricky, because when I pick up a book/movie labeled "horror" I'm expecting to be scared. But some authors seem to make it about seeing how much they can shock you/gross you out

And like, that's fine I guess. But it's not ✨scary✨
===
@freedarko Torn was originally a punk/pop song by Ednaswap, then got covered by Natalie Imbruglia as, eh, whatever genre it is (girlpop?) and the cover was on every WB show or similar themed movie for 10 years.
===
@FreddyInSpace @smahal1 I apply this complaint to every category. I can accept not celebrating genre films every year.  It doesn't bother me that sometimes the wrong movie wins or is nominated. What bothers me is that the same type of movies are nominated and celebrated every time regardless of quality.

@ashleylynch Not only is "Space Man From Pluto" about as "genre" a title as you can get (like, dude even addresses the fact of the idea that the title will make audiences think it's a cheap sci-fi movie), it makes zero sense as a title for the story and relates to the story in no way.
===
(cont) Fans of the revenge genre will enjoy this movie for its A-list cast and great acting. A slow-burn film that proves some relationships only require a few days to change you completely. 

Available to watch on Netflix; for mature audiences due to language &amp; violence.
===
@ChrisB_7300 @screwfacecapone Because it is? For the comic book movie genre. Budget was 200+ million vs most comic book films (done in studios) usual 150 million budget... Where you all think most of that went? Blockbusters don’t shoot that way anymore, especially huge ensemble ones. It’s a risk for Disney
===
Each of these backlashes are organized around the premise that the genre that is currently popular isn't "real" cinema, where "real" cinema is a constantly fluctuating entity that can't really be pinned down because

CINEMA ISN'T A GENRE. It's medium.
===
@dash_k_dot I basically like horror because it gets me to think about it even after i finish the movie 

And my favourite sub genre is of those movies where you're alone in your home and you have unexpected guests in home terrorising you I don't know it's name so help me out
===
@skipbolden I used to catch all of these movies at the air conditioned, and long lost Olympia Cinema on 107th and Broadway. There was a certain graphic style to the posters of that era and genre. https://t.co/WhSF9I1dwA

Mexican politics are like the movie #Sharknato, you know the plot doesn't make sense, but gosh! They have become a saga of cult for their specific genre. Like that Mexican politicians seem so out of their reality but as a society we don't know what's real anymore. Unbelievable!
===
Captain America: The Winter Soldier on the Mt. Rushmore of comic book/superhero movie genre lol.. it is a fucking masterpiece! Captain America: The Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight, Spider-Man 2 made w Sony, and Deadpool! Maaannneee! 😂😩😩😭😭💪💪💯💯🔥!😎😎..

So, today is #NationalSuperheroDay. But I don’t feel like saying which is the best super-hero movie or series, or which is my favorite. No, I wanna talk about what inspired me to be someone greater. I’m a big fan of the genre but I’ve never really been inspired by it. 1/
===
my least favorite movie genre is "watching a shitty movie for an actor i like"
===
@Charles80035983 Hmm...I must say that I am not the most familiar with film directors. I suppose it would depend on the genre. Perhaps Guillermo del Toro? I heard he made a movie about Finn James.
===
my favorite genre of Disney movie is the ones where animals take care of abandoned human babies and claim them as their own...i wish that were me

@moonkissedvenus Haha I understand! I love the genre, cliche strong Scorpio/Lilith placements 💀 are you taking astro notes regarding the movie? Or as an additional thing you’re doing.
===
@scottEmovienerd The Mummy (1999), because it perfectly mixes every genre and adventurous thrilling element into a Wonderous movie led by Brendan Fraser that’s joyous for all ages.
===
@PamsHarIey @ECNALHANID I love when the comic book genre does something new and different. Variety has been the lifeblood of comics forever. I don’t need every DC movie or show to be super serious and I don’t need every Marvel show or film to be a comedy. I enjoy good stories with good characters.
===
@RetroBoyJon My personal favorite Ghibli movie. Laputa / Castle in the Sky.

Everything is here. Romance, comedy, adventure, sad scene (which idk the genre for), and the dub is also great. I love the dub more to be precise.

Also, i strongly believe that this movie inspired Grandia.
===
Eventually Peters got his way in the movie Wild Wild West, and that’s how we got stuck with Will Smith fighting a giant mechanical spider as the climax of what was supposed to be a revival of the Western genre.
===
@RPGKitchen @mightynarwhal1 It's called Morra: The Cinematic Universal RPG and borrows heavily from the language of cinema to build a fast-paced game that I personally think hits the sweet spot between rules-oriented and narrative-oriented. I edited the ms &amp; wrote a Genre (setting doc) called Punching Nazis
===
@ashleylynch …and “Space Man From Pluto” doesn’t stink of cheap genre fare?

Look I get hindsight and all that but even as a kid I think a movie called “Back to the Future” would have more zing, mystery, and pop than “Space Man From Pluto.”

@dj2dj1978 Me too, but I'll happily see Jamie in any genre of movie

5) his use of cinema/film as a reason/excuse to break with the brand. Purple Rain is an album made in character, that allowed him to crossover to White America in an unprecedented way. Parade is an absolutely exquisite recontextualisation of Princeness as genre-less soundtrack.

@m4part2 @NintendoAmerica I like some rail shooters, however you can’t lie and say it isn’t an inherently limited genre. Progression, interaction, reward, are limited compared to other genres. The game isnt had but it shouldnt be $60. And thanks for proving my point about Nintendo fans and “movie games”.

We Broke Up is a movie about a failed relationship that fails itself to have any meaningful substance. Most of all though it fails its' stars, William Jackson Harper and Aya Cash, who deserve a better showcase for their talents in this genre. https://t.co/u8K6ygfv0z

I think of 'Chick Lit' and/or 'Chick Flick' as an all encompassing genre term for any book and/or movie for anything marketed toward women. Anytime you search either term you will get anything marketed toward women.
