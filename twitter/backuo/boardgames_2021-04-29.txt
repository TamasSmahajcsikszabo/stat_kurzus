Yeah, I'm turning the game off, I have to actually try and relax for once. Arsenal aren't doing it for me anymore and the arrogance behind Arsenal(Arteta and the board) is annoying. Nonsense quotes followed by nonsense in the performances. Goodnight.

One of my favourite memories EVER is of my eldest nephew opening a board game Christmas present and declaring ‚ÄúYES, I‚ÄôVE GOT GUESS‚ÄôN WHOM.‚Äù

The same nephew also once told me he was ‚ÄúFour-Foot-Stone‚Äù and then cried when I burst out laughing.

Swings and roundabouts.

@YankeeGunner I‚Äôd seen rumors about the board having lost patience with him this week. If they weren‚Äôt true before this game, they certainly will be after.

@MasonGinsberg Yes, I believe that if Adams went after every board on his own he would average 4 more a game but the team rebounding would suffer. Also if Zion was not forced to guard on the perimeter &amp; leak out in transition he would have more rebounds.

No complaining about Matt Carpenter today, folks, for he just nailed a three-run homer to finally put the #STLCards on the board in this game, and into the lead. 3-1 in the 6th!

@CoachLisleSBall @abaseballjunkie I suppose my point is specific to the original tweet. If we want to streamline terminology, it probably needs to happen across the board. Off speed doesn‚Äôt bother me as much as mound/circle. It‚Äôs a unique aspect of the game. Great discussion.

@Alexander_Umut @tabali_tigi @SenFoongLim Quite right. And anyone who can't figure out the thick line between poor research and deliberate malice, at least in board game design, needs to go talk to a therapist.
===
@tabali_tigi @SenFoongLim My fellow Indians are as free to design Indian themed board game / incorporate elements as any non-Indian and monetize it. 

If it's good, it sells. If not, it goes to garbage bin of history.
===
@tabali_tigi @SenFoongLim It's a game. Board games are played by a tiny population. Getting cultural elements right is good and desirable but getting it wrong doesn't do any real harm.
===
@tabali_tigi @SenFoongLim Thanks for reminding me that what I need less of is mindless woke sermons. 

Yes, we Indians were oppressed by the British. A hundred years ago!!! 

Today, if some Brit gets a cultural element wrong in a board game, it's poor research, not malicious oppression.

@Ectricark @gr_press @thedandilion @TheCardboardDu1 @SenFoongLim There's a lot of space between "talk to people who know your subject" and "you must hire a paid consultant" to make a board game.
===
@SenFoongLim You might be right, considering how sensitive this topic is. Having a person familiar with it on board is extremely helpful, if not a must. Not all topics are this sensitive though. I‚Äôm sure you can make a game about, let‚Äôs say, Octoberfest, without hiring a German national :)

@LigeiasGarden @David_Leavitt @BlueOrangeGames @ThamesAndKosmos @biggcreativellc @Asmodee_USA @FFGames @FloodgateGames @Gamewright @skyboundtabletp @GaleForceNine @FunkoGames Your should check out Risk: Legacy. It starts of as regular Risk, but with each play you change the game in different ways. You add to the board or gain special abilities or set global effects. By the end, you've basically created a unique variant of the game.

To accommodate the change in board size, the total number of pieces will also increase from 32 (16 per side) to 1,024. But that is merely a derivative change, you are told, to fit the game to the new board.

@SatiricusRex @GameMinimalist If people are getting together to play board games, they are board gamers, regardless of the weight or category of their games.

In my experience as both a backer and somebody with 3 successful campaigns under my belt, nobody who wasn't going to back the campaign already sees a stretch goal and thinks, "Oh okay, NOW I'm in!"

Unless you're running a ¬£1million board game KS, you don't need stretch goals.

It‚Äôs important to remember that not all avenues maybe legally exploitable &amp; could be better addressed via other mechanisms such as the scheme advisory board, pensions ombudsman etc... also, like any game of poker, it‚Äôs always best not to show a full hand until you have to.

@gehitmusiken I mostly just lack the patience, personally. I'd much rather make a board game, not a video game. Just seems a bit easier and I have a few more friends who'd probably be willing to play test and all that.

Oh no. Nibbler‚Äôs been sleeping next to this board game for hours and he just woke up and realized it‚Äôs made of toys.

(Also yes I realize now I rolled a 4. Nibbler‚Äôs the one who rolled the 6.) https://t.co/E4HxG0hul0

I've just noticed there is a kickstarter for a Monster Hunter World board game finishing v soon that looks extremely cool. Trying v hard to resist tho because it is ¬£300 all in and it will almost certainly just sit in a cupboard unplayed like 95% of my board games.

@AndreSegers I have a question.
What happens, if, during a Super Mario Party Online game, a player goes Idle during the board game portion, or the practice screen?
Does the game do anything to force them to hurry up?

I think a player on the board has a different goal to what it may appear, has decided to play the long game &amp; been quietly &amp; methodically moving to that outcome. They‚Äôre blending in by being exemplary (in fact that may have been noted) - endgame is upon us! #LineOfDuty6

@symatt D&amp;D for me. It was my second ever game and I love that it keeps bringing new people into the hobby but I've always seen it as an overly complicated boardgame.

@finecountryazu1 I knew City could win that game yesterday because they are more of a team than PSG who only rely on individual players. If you call idrissa gueye's tackle on gundogan wicked then what the nwfl board did was wickedness over board because they lied to Nigerians.

@makgadikadian ideas:
- make a board game out of it... like Monopoly, kinda 
- use discrete event modelling systems to simulate
  - systems in equilibrium given input constraints
  - systems transitioning between equilibrium states
- all of the above (gamify the simulation)

@Foden___ @mcfchamdan You did not watch either game with that opinion. First half of the Chelsea game was the best football I‚Äôve watched in 18 months, by both teams. PSG City game was a mess across the board, defensive blunders on all 3 goals pretty much. I bet hard on city today bud and was lucky ü§£

@GaryLineker @sisteers @ManCity Gary instead of arguing on this platform is there any way you would be able to get a program together with people like @sisteers to discuss footballs issue from their point of view across the board, so that you don't dismiss genuine worries about the game as petty tribalism?
