good night. i hope you all learn what morals and human rights are.

@strauss_matt @abirballan A much better statement would have *medical tyranny* in those quote marks; this isn't an issue of best preventative health care measures, it's an issue of States worldwide mandating whatever measures they choose, which is abusive control, and a very dangerous precedent being set.

@abirballan There goes their tourist industry.
===
@RestorationGame @425suzanne Happy birthday, Suz! What does it feel like to turn 28?
===
@RestorationGame @425suzanne I don‚Äôt know how most companies seem to struggle with recruitment, when your policy of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just hire the most awesome people‚Äù seems to be going pretty well.
Happy birthday Suz! Will need pie updates later üòÄ

@abirballan they are running out of time
===
If you follow this account, you probably already know that it's @425suzanne's birthday. Hoping she has a great day of maximum pie and minimum pun. But it seems like a good time for me to say how much I truly love this person. She is the very best of us. She is my polestar.

@abirballan @HealthFreedomIE @FatEmperor I done this today and the only response I got was the office of Mick Wallace. Thanks Mick.

Happy birthday to @425suzanne! Thank you for being a great Internet Pal, for making our community better, and for correctly guessing the price of a mechanical dancing toaster that one time.
===
@425suzanne Happy birthday @425suzanne!
===
@425suzanne Happy day of your birth. May your day be filled with pie!!!

Happy Birthday @425suzanne 

Thank you for all that you bring to the hobby, and for being a really awesome human!

May your day be filled with all the pie your heart desires. üòÅ

@OneiroTourist @425suzanne Ah good! I had fun making those ones - it actually feels like less pressure to make a campaign like that because an experimental level is just 10% of the overall thing.

@425suzanne Yesterday I promised my kids a MILLION dollars EACH if we could go an entire dinner without someone complaining or fighting. It sounds like our kids are on a similar wavelength.
===
@425suzanne Happy Birthday! I promise I won‚Äôt argue with my siblings today.

@425suzanne Hope you have a shiny, happy day Suz! https://t.co/SYyhGZMRXo

@robinwriting @425suzanne Both, really! Singapore is a wholly different thought process with those unlockables that explode the puzzle even further in such a cool way. I talked aloud to myself A LOT during that one.  Chicago's gimmick was just plain neat!

@MahirD @abirballan @100trillionUSD People die. Why are you so opposed to death. What media network has you fearing the inevitable. Is there a bubble you can go live in.
===
@425suzanne HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!
===
Suz is a tireless champion for underrepresented people in the tabletop industry and an inspiration to many (including myself). She's also got fantastic taste in pie. Happy birthday @425suzanne!  
Buy her a coffee for her birthday! https://t.co/bfCoX4d2RR

===
I just learned that it's @425suzanne's birthday!

Suzanne's one of my favorite people in the board gaming hobby, and someone I look to as an example not only for her content, but her attitude and voice.

Happy Birthday, Suzanne!
===
@425suzanne Happy birthday!!!
===
@425suzanne Happy birthday!

I assume you have birthday pie instead of birthday cake.

@425suzanne OMG HAPPY BIRTHDAY SUZ!!! may it be filled with pies and games and joy ‚ù§Ô∏è

@425suzanne Hahaha that‚Äôs so cute. Happy Birthday!!! I wish you a lifetime of the best pie in the world!

@425suzanne I mean. As a former parent. I appreciate the honesty. Also, Merry ‚ÄúOperations: Escape Womb‚Äù Memorial Day.

@425suzanne Just want to make sure as many people as possible get the chance to celebrate the greatness that is you!
===
Whether you can make a kofi gift or not, I would encourage everyone to pass along a "thanks" and a kind word to @425suzanne (I now understand the 425) today on her day. :) She's put a lot of herself into this Hobby that we love and that deserves some of respect and gratitude. &lt;3 https://t.co/CPChmrs4TM

@425suzanne @CrystalDax Happy birthday Suz... may all your rolls be right today!
===
Did you know that today is a really special day? It‚Äôs @425suzanne‚Äôs birthday.

You might know Suz for a variety of things, like podcasting or her vast knowledge of roll and write games, app games, hard-to-acquire games &amp; pie.

But those aren‚Äôt the reasons I love her (thread)

Happy Birthday @425suzanne! Here's hoping on this special day you:

-get to eat the pie(s) of your dreams
-cram in as many roll-and-write games as is physically possible in 24 hours
-acquire a dog toy that Maple cannot destroy
-receive much deserved love from friends! https://t.co/PBhWd9Q0L3

@425suzanne Kids are funny because they are honest. Happy birthday!

@425suzanne And happy birthday!!!

@425suzanne I hope so too! The waiting is really hard. On the bright side, with supply ramping up maybe when you get to make an appt you won't have to wait long. (and I'm really glad your folks got their doses!)

@abirballan @mercola This doesn‚Äôt prove anything. Suicide rates are always going up and down. Anti-depressants are being prescribed more because people are actually seeking help because of mental health awareness. Lockdowns proved a lot of jobs are obsolete and people need to learn to adapt.
===
@425suzanne Happy birthday! Likewise, I would love to agree not to make a pun at you today, but that already feels dated.

@425suzanne I'll be impressed if you can keep it all within a single folder.

@425suzanne Hey - I won't argue with your kids today.  Happy birthday!

@aerigoms_ @bhyuncock brands like h&amp;m Nike Adidas said they resist using Xinjiang cotton and  said it's harvested by forced labor. while actually, there's no forced labour in Xinjiang at all. people in Xinjiang harvest cotton with collecting machines.
