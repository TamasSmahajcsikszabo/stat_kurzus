I loaded up the #pressurepot today 😂 Should be able to demold everything around 2pm tomorrow. Poked a piece or two so may be some collateral damage 😬

And I get to see how badly I mucked up the foil on the #dicetower (dark resin is not see through!) 😅🤷‍♀️ https://t.co/N7YeTIXRiY

I love the feedback and game balance so far 😊 and we played with our #DiceTower 😃
