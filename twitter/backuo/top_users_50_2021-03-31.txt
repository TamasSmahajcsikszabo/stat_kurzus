@GailSimone In MST3K's first year, on a local Mpls UHF channel, they did a whole series of Gamera films. Joel's deadpan delivery of :"No way. I may believe a giant turtle with laser vision, but no way a car sliced in 1/2 can still drive. That's just fantasy." haunts me to this day.

@GailSimone The hottest one

@GailSimone No argument here

@GailSimone No. I think you're right.
===
@GailSimone Yes to Gamera if they could get the rights, but also... FRANKENSTEIN'S MONSTER!!!! https://t.co/6a1KFv2sHe
===
@GailSimone My favorite has always been Malcolm X. https://t.co/KuC27vtdHK
===
@caldyr99 @GailSimone Don't forget Malcolm X and Terminator X.
===
@GailSimone McConnell?
===
@GailSimone Gamera would never make it through the whole movie as he'll be taken out by a plastic straw.

Why hasn't @DCComics made @GailSimone a showrunner or let her write the script for a movie (*cough* Batgirl *cough*)? This is a great miscarriage of justice.
===
@tonyjudge @GailSimone OMG!! I came here to say this.
Wolverine wasn‚Äôt even created until 11 years later. Incredible Hulk 180-181.

She‚Äôs thinking Giant Size X-Men #1 w/ Krakoa.
I think Nightcrawler, Storm, Thunderbird and Colossus were all created for that issue.
===
@GailSimone I see you. And I will also add.... https://t.co/lD1Kw2jrkG

@GailSimone @PushinUpRoses Thanks for saying this, cause like, what with the whole celebrity thing, it probably means at least a little more coming from you... and I want it to mean as much as possible for Roses.  She's really fucking poggers.

@GailSimone bu--ut you're right. Do we HAVE to fight?

@GailSimone Vlasic pickles kills you, steals your baby, and delivers it to another family
===
@GailSimone Can't argue with that. An underrated film with him was Nicholas Nickelby. Great casting, story, and also featured the late great Christopher Plummer.
===
Gail, stop. https://t.co/LNvbHx91fH
===
@GailSimone Love me some Gamera.  And Ultraman.  Maybe a buddy movie where they go on an island vacation &amp; accidentally wake up Big Poppi Godzilla?
===
@GailSimone i didn't even know this day existed v.v
thank you &lt;3
===
@GailSimone Not going to argue he wasn't extremely well cast.

I just can't put him over Stewart, McKellen, or Jackman.   Would you settle for saying he's top 4?
===
@GailSimone Agreed. https://t.co/THV2xbWI6C
===
@Rodzam71 @GailSimone Yup- the swear words are what are holding us back...and he wouldn‚Äôt get get Skull Island‚Äôs plot/motivation.

But even GKotM where the first words are ‚ÄúSh*t! Sh*t! Sh*t!‚Äù- that just doesn‚Äôt work for his age.

@GailSimone Did the Gobot win?
===
@GailSimone Mostly agreed. Woefully under utilized. Which I‚Äôd say is true for most of the cast. I hope Disney dials back the character number and focuses on a core group. Branching solo movies introducing new characters etc.
===
@GailSimone ... "Nice" is code for can eviscerate a rampaging T-Rex.
===
@GailSimone Full inside story?
Cause I really hope it's the full inside story.

Though I also still owe Snyder about 2-3 'whatever he wants to make' movies from all of that.

On that topic also tho, I really want to have that long overdue discussion on Suckerpunch.
===
@GailSimone Same.
Every fear I had of the movie was washed away. That final battle was perfection, and sets up so much.
===
@GailSimone Funnily enough, I was actually thinking the same thing, but also, not exactly.

Going to have to spitball some ideas, but definitely going to have to push for more movies &amp; side material.

GvK came out perfection.
===
Where is the lie

I will add Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth and Kelsey Grammer as Beast. Underrated, under-explored, underused and they were both perfect.. a real pity.

@GailSimone There is no arguing because you are correct. The movie was shite but he was fantastic
===
@GailSimone Oh and Nightcrawler has always been a favourite of mine. In the one season cartoon Wolverine and the Xmen they had him take out Spiral from Mojo World by teleporting holding her metal arms and then threatening to do the same with her 'fleshy' ones.

@realmarkrez @GailSimone I have a hard time choosing between Gabby &amp; Brooklyn.
===
@GailSimone I'd be down for Monsterverse to incorporate Gamera.
===
@starlightgeek @GailSimone Yup. You‚Äôre sitting on that couch right THERE!
===
@GailSimone It's probably the best cast, with the most under used acting opportunities of all comics movies.

Every role had the perfect actor for the job in hand, but the limelight was aimed at a few, rather than the whole ensemble.
===
@GailSimone I unironically love the 3 90‚Äôs Gamera movies. My favorite rubber suit monster movies.
===
@GailSimone I will argue. Fassbender is an abuser and does not deserve the role. Also it should go to someone Jewish.

@GailSimone He's friend to all children!
===
@JaydeColer @cinemasins @GailSimone The controversy is from all the people that can't separate the actors performance from the script when it comes to judging a cast.

Seen so many blamed for not being able to entirely save a weak role and so many praised for terrible performances purely because they got carried.
===
@trickstertao @GailSimone @VancityReynolds That was a script problem not a casting one the opening of the film was the only part where he was really Deadpool and he killed it there.

@GailSimone My only regret with this movies is that my 6 yr old can't watch them yet because of the curse words and human violence. He is so excited to finally be able to watch the modern monsterverse. If Gamera is added to the mix we may have to break the rules and let him watch it.

@GailSimone Only one I disagree with is @RealHughJackman as Wolvie. He is too tall &amp; attractive. Logan is supposed to be short &amp; ugly. Like @DannyDeVito
===
@GailSimone Love you too, Gail
===
@GailSimone Please write this movie
===
@GailSimone I agree https://t.co/ZetTIzdzO3
===
@thewendynerd @GailSimone don't worry, he's perfectly recognizable
===
@huwbowen @GailSimone Zazie Beetz as Domino just kills it too. Definitely the best thing in D2.
===
@GailSimone I hate every part of this üòÜ
===
@MnMJax @GailSimone Use lube...
===
@MnMJax @GailSimone Sorry, wrong thread... carry on üò£...
===
@GailSimone I am waiting for the sequel: 
Spider-man: Into the Snyderverse.
===
@GailSimone What? No! I‚Äôll lose all my stealth bonuses!
===
@blindrapture @GailSimone it's true. fascists have no empathy so they can't imagine other people having it too. it must be a psyop.
===
@GailSimone Monkey-lizard fight! YAY!!
===
@ithayla @GailSimone Usually when cis people get harassed for its because they assume they **must** be trans themselves if they are supporting us.
===
@GailSimone Goodness lady! Do you ever sleep??? Of course, I have been up all night so I've got no room to talk. üòÇ
===
@GailSimone ME TOO!!! üòÇüòéüòÇ
===
@GailSimone I love you too!
===
@GailSimone !!!! Thank you! Would have been an absolute shame for my potato-cheddar-leek soup to end up as a sacrifice to the floor gods!

*slurps, fades back into the cave of nonbinary invisibility*
===
@GailSimone OH SHIT YOU CAN SEE ME?!
===
@GailSimone NO I LOVE YOU!
===
@GailSimone Without a Microwave? Blasphemy!! Next you'll be saying there is no marmite on the crumpets??!?!!?!
===
@GailSimone Not surprising, he's just a spoiled rich kid who wiggled his way into politics......I've always been a fan of his mugshot. It was before he started going for that sexy receding hairline pompadour. https://t.co/rG2nDZ0Du0
===
@GailSimone But I still don't understand why the Eagles couldn't fly them straight to Mount Doom.
===
@GailSimone And we love you right back. Thank you for using your voice.
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography Maybe with the film Black Adam they will make a mini series since there is Hawkman in the film.
Super Cosplayüëèüëè
===
@hbomax,please #RestoreTheSnyderVerse https://t.co/eemyYPO65F
===
@GailSimone Amazing scenes but poor story telling. 6/10
===
@GailSimone I did enjoyed it tho...
===
@mvbrat91 @GailSimone I love the last one he looks like a dog seeing another dog that he doesnt like i wanna pet his lil ears and go "ohhhh is that your arch nemesis? Are they evil? Oh who's a brave little boy"
===
@GailSimone I can't argue, Alan Cumming was perfect.  I loved his portrayal of my favorite X-Man.
===
@Candlelands @GailSimone Sorr, nope. Kitty Pryde.
===
@GailSimone IT WAS SO COOL!
===
@GailSimone It was damn good. I still wish I could go see it in a theater though
===
@GailSimone I love to see another cinematic universe come together so well
===
@LLana723 @GailSimone @BabyGotBacchus You might like this green screen project I did in art school lol https://t.co/MiLPX4Vyx8
===
@GailSimone Is it a controversial opinion when it‚Äôs objectively true?
===
@nerdsingerbeej @GailSimone Wait... Did Gail decide on her new Blood Feud?!?
===
@GailSimone Not that he wasn't good looking but making nightcrawler come across as other than Beast look-a-like was incredible for whoever did the make up.
===
@GailSimone and whoever did his make up made him beautiful.
===
@GailSimone And a senior too :(
===
@GailSimone True. There wasn't any first appearance of Nightcrawler before Giant-Size X-Men 1
===
@pmjeterjr @GailSimone They already said the Knightmare(s) were inspired from Injustice
===
@GailSimone I'm guessing you microwaved your iced tea.
===
@GailSimone Sounds like what a Terminator would say...
===
@GailSimone Yeah its out
===
@kurtcarty @GailSimone This reverse is a fakey
===
@BabyGotBacchus @GailSimone Just finished watching it and should go to sleep. But maybe I'll watch it again instead.
===
@GailSimone Nightcrawler somehow managed to look the least human while being the most human. Best character among the bunch.
===
@HerrWillhelm @Freeze92 @widely_ranged @GailSimone AND he got it wrong...
===
@GailSimone If they‚Äôre truly honest with why they acted so inhumanely towards that woman, can they really consider themselves to be good people?
===
@GailSimone Totally agree, though I'd love to see Rebecca Romiin as Mystique on there as well. She had such great body language!
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Way to keep plugging your new book every chance you get. We get it. You're in the big leagues. You write Nightwing.üôÑ
===
@stonercinderlla @TheSeanShowNZ @princessnaked @GailSimone @RonFunches It would have been MUCH better if they kept the original premise from the SDCC Pilot - they were an insurance agency with Alan Tudyk trying to get Vanessa Hudgens and the others to deny people's claims! More broad references to DC than simply "Bruce Wayne is my cousin" on repeat!
===
@SwiftofOpal @tara_oshea @GailSimone @RonFunches I don't know whether it was just the writing, or the writing and Hudgens acting, but yeah, it just didn't work... Should have stuck with it being an insurance agency, not Wayne Enterprises - R&amp;D Division
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôm not enjoying it
‚ù§Ô∏è
===
@SkywalkerHell @GailSimone I found ‚ÄúBurlesque‚Äù to be an alright but disappointing movie, but getting to see Alan Cumming in it is defs the best part
===
I absolutely refuse to argue with this. It is impossible to disagree. https://t.co/vtGoBfoTtR
===
@thatcardsharp @GailSimone Seconded
===
@SavaniaGames Nice work Savania Games; you're also turning out to be our biggest support on our end! So THANK YOU!
===
@BabyGotBacchus @GailSimone KAIJU NERD FOR LIFE
===
@fearofmonkeys @GailSimone The pacing was perfect to me
===
@fearofmonkeys @GailSimone The assembly cut was almost 5 hours while the Snyder cut is like 3:50 if you take out the additional photography, and editing isn't just trimming and shortening a film, it's much more than that.
===
@fearofmonkeys @GailSimone Nah, the editing was near perfect.
===
@jertim @GailSimone I might give you Blade
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôll go further.  His White House scene is the best opening act of any superhero film so far.
===
@MeepleU pc gamer
===
@GailSimone @Kesswylie If the best is James Marsden I'm on board.
===
@UzamakiJ I knew that either you or @GailSimone would jump on this. Nerds ‚ù§Ô∏è (I love it)
===
@GailSimone üíØ 100% agree to all of this
===
@SavaniaGames Congrats üòé
===
@bullock_bits @GailSimone Clearly Night Crawler was an original member of the Giant X-Men, not the original X-Men üòÇüòú
===
@GailSimone I'm out of work at noon.
I will be watching this at approximately 12:17. ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
===
@SavaniaGames hey there! Thank you so much for following me, it really is a complimentü§ó
===
@GailSimone @SpiderMalk Nope. He was awesome.

@GailSimone Liev Schreiber was an excellent choice for Victor Creed. I wasn‚Äôt sure when the casting was announced, but he was the one redeeming quality in XMO:W.

Brian Cox as William Stryker, in X2, was excellent as well.
===
@GailSimone Perfect casting! The opening scene of X2, The White House infiltration, is my favorite sequence in the entire Fox X-Men series!
===
@GailSimone No Kelsey Grammer as Beast? Sacrilege
===

@zbeg @ZenOfDesign @GailSimone I remember watching this movie on the theather. We were a bit late, so we got there right when that scene was happening. I was in full shock how cool it is
===
@S_U_A_R @GailSimone Yep, perfect casting
===
@GailSimone Nah, I'm pretty ok with that.
===
@GailSimone Amazing
===
@GailSimone isn't kaiju that bald, spoiled cartoon kid everyone hates?
===
Didn't realize that wynonna earp was shot in Calgary and the surrounding areas. Been shooting here for 4 years now and we've had the cast at @Calgaryexpo zero times.. This needs to be rectified. Perhaps we can get @GailSimone at the same time.

@pmjeterjr @GailSimone Knightmare is a possible future that the heroes would try to prevent. It's not the status quo Snyder wanted (whereas it's the status quo of Injustice). JL3 would feature Superman leading the Justice League in a final battle against Darkseid.
===
@GailSimone How can anybody argue with you when literally everybody agrees with you?

@GailSimone If a barber fixes a botched mustache, is that called a Snyder Cut?

@GailSimone I can't argue with you. Recently watched X2 for the first time in several years and he is my favorite part of it. That introductory scene with Kurt BAMFing all over the place is still incredible to watch.

@JairusKhan @GailSimone I would watch 2 hours of Fassbender as Magneto hunting Nazis in the 50s and 60s.
===
People mostly aren't arguing but I will argue.
Kurt isnt nervous and awkward like that. He's playful and entirely comfortable in his own skin.
Also he's athletically built and Errol Flynn-handsome https://t.co/eOg8t6gktH
===
@GailSimone What's to argue?
===
@GailSimone The opening scene of X2, Nightcrawler‚Äôs assault on the White House, is arguably the high point of the first three movies. No action scene in all three movies tops that scene.
===
@artbyatlas0 @GailSimone I‚Äôm glad u said most lol. I‚Äôll never forgive them for not using Jubilee more
===
@GailSimone You mind sharing your thoughts ?
#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
===
@AliciLee *activates the @GailSimone signal*
*it's like the bat signal with a stylized bear instead*

(third time's the charm apparently)
===
@widely_ranged @TheDemonClown @GailSimone You haven't been following Gail for very long, eh? üòÇ
===
I love waking up to see what @GailSimone has tweeted and everyone's replies to her. A twitter black hole I'm happy to fall into regularly. üòÖ
===
@GailSimone No argument can be had because you are correct!
===
@GailSimone How about if we agree with you, then we are not facilitating your need for an argument?
===
@GabrielJBell @GailSimone Gail every day: https://t.co/aSfM8UvbwW
===
@BofurDeeznuts @widely_ranged @GailSimone The day this happened would be the day this joke died, and I would miss the joke, but would welcome the progress.
===
@GailSimone But have you seen the Snidley Cut?
===
@JamesGunn @notfunnyking @cannibalgnome @GailSimone cool
===
@GailSimone Alan Cummings is exemplary in everything he‚Äôs cast in
===
@GailSimone Correct
===
@CharlesJohnDaw2 @GailSimone Almost every major villain has at one point or another made it onto the team, so that‚Äôs a tough one to answer. The real answer is...shitty humans I guess?
===
@GailSimone To hell with everyone saying Kurt wasn‚Äôt an OG X-Man. The team was essentially defined by the Claremont run. That‚Äôs as OG as it gets.
===
@DOSeatDog @Matthew_S_Brown @GailSimone Pretty sure it was spelled Mad-Damme Mar-Vell
===
@BeingA_R_S @EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone I‚Äôm partial to Prince Valiant and Hagar the Horrible myself.
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone If we could avoid ‚Äúwell actually-ing‚Äù professional comics writers on things like this that‚Äôd be fantastic.
===
@caldyr99 @GailSimone You forgot Adam X
===
No argument here. This is solid and I've gushed over Alan Cumming's Nightcrawler for years myself. Would have watched an entire film of him, easily. https://t.co/lvMYi2Leao
===
@Rosgakori @GailSimone Seconded for Kelsey Grammer. He absolutely nailed Beast, and was totally sidelined by a terrible script. I wish we could still get him back for a proper spin.
===
@ZenOfDesign @GailSimone I still just watch that scene mouth agape at how fluid the entire sequence is. It's remarkable.
===
@writesoulfully @GailSimone Whachin it rihjht now https://t.co/AQPFsxS9A4

@writesoulfully @GailSimone Still goink. I thimp I have my scond wind

@GailSimone Am I live blogging? Yes, I'm li- ... uh, maybe, if I don't fall asleep.
===
@writesoulfully @GailSimone Well, I am drinking Coca Cola that has caffeine in it - and bourbon. LOTS of bourbon. We'll see which one wins out.
===
@GailSimone @SFdirewolf I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY IN A STRENUOUSLY COMBATIVE MANNER
===
@GailSimone Glad for the support. Curious who the ‚Äúwe‚Äù is though. ü§ó
===
@GailSimone Here for some Kaiju taint talk.
===
@GailSimone I wonder who wins  
Haven't seen final edit  
Tell me how it goes
===
@GailSimone I can't believe you'd be so ignorant.

This is clearly the Fantastic Four.
===
Of course it sold out! @GailSimone's name is in big, bold letters on the front! (Please take note of this @DCComics: Simone + omnibus = money. That being said, the people want a Villains United/Secret Six omnibus!) https://t.co/sXQSNNB7P2
===
@GailSimone Of course it sold out! Your name is in big, bold letters on the front! (Please take note of this @DCComics: @GailSimone + omnibus = money. That being said, the people want a Villains United/Secret Six omnibus!)
===
@ZenOfDesign @GailSimone It's definitely in the top 5. Winter Soldier, Blade, X-Men 2, Logan, Watchmen, in no particular order.
===
@GailSimone Second best seems a tad high, but I totally agree with the rest of your points!
===
@frankiebwash @GailSimone @hbomax @GodzillaVsKong @kongskullisland @LegendaryComics Me watching such talent in action... https://t.co/A7kRIwdWmw
===
@PhillipLozano6 @GailSimone I had rum and Coke, the rum won. ü•±
===
@GailSimone O.M.G girl! BARGAIN of all bargains! I want to read the Whoniverse because I adore The Doctor, but also like Billy Crystal, so two wins in my book! Congrats! üéâ
===
@GailSimone Wish I could join in the fun!! Also, wish real watch parties were still a thing. #maybesomeday
===
@StayAtHomeJeff @GailSimone Hell yeah! Looks comfy and awesome.

@GailSimone Same here.

@LinternaVerde80 @BiaKing93 @GailSimone @TomTaylorMade Don't you mean 90s greatness

@Wiswell @justin_golight @GailSimone must know
===
@AbbitJay @GailSimone You monster
===
@AbbitJay @GailSimone Who are rooting for? The monkey or lizard?
===
@GailSimone He‚Äôs an amazing character. Truly.
===
@GailSimone ...I wish they'd make him FUZZY! He's supposed to be fuzzy.  T^T I mean, if they can make Cats,  they can make Nightcrawler soft.
===
She's not wrong. https://t.co/lsNiAA25ip https://t.co/eqBIw4pzCL
===
@GailSimone So Batgirl takes a collection of books from the same series back to the library? Doesn't sound very exciting, but with your track record I know it'll be great...bet she gets a fine for a late return or something.  #BatgirlReturnsOmnibus https://t.co/cvYKhSgJj1
===
Gail Simone talked to Zack Snyder?ü§î https://t.co/C3T7YFJ0ov
===
@SpinkMiles @GailSimone Thank you!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
===
@GailSimone Interesting- why?
===
@GailSimone What did the omnibus do that made Batgirl return it?

(I'll see myself out.)
===
@evergreenburrow @bonniegrrl if this doesn't scream @GailSimone
===
Completely agree ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/vChKmXe8lT
===
@GailSimone I like Nightcrawler a lot
===
@cloudspretty @GailSimone And it‚Äôs not even close.
===
@GailSimone Yep. Store tried to order more, but said the supplier is out of stock it looks like.
===
Picked up this behemoth from my LCS last week. Lucky to get it, as they sold out. Read all the issues, and still have them. But this is a beauty and I had to have it. @GailSimone https://t.co/wqr2wzE4bY
===
@GailSimone Low key... most of the casting was OUTSTANDING. Stewart was epic as Xavier, Marsden fit Cyclops to a T, Cox was great as (Singer‚Äôs version) of Styker, etc. eveything wrong with those movies was the writing and characterizations on occasions in my opinion ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
===
@GailSimone enjoy! It was a fun movie
===
@GailSimone Nearly every Omnibus that has released this past year sells out almost immediately. Wish they would print more, especially of key historical runs, or at least open them up to additional printings if enough requests come in.
===
I truly wonder if @VancityReynolds has a #MagicPorch like @GailSimone does? 

Imagine #Deadpool opening a #MysteriousBox full of goodies. 

What do you think would be inside #Deadpool's mystery box on his #MagicPorch?
===
@GailSimone started a Twitter war with her tomfoolery with #GozillaVSKong. #TeamGodzilla #Piledrives the #Kong all day long.
===
@marvwolfman @GailSimone @hbomax Wrong #Godzilla bite-crunches-slings his #ape away. #TeamGodzilla time to mop the floor with #Kong.
===
He was so lucky I tried getting a #BatGirlReturnsOmnibus and they were gone. He should feel lucky. https://t.co/KxU4k5SieQ
===
@GailSimone Oooh! Looking forward to watching it this weekend myself! ‚ò∫
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôve always wondered what the X-Men would‚Äôve been like if Nightcrawler had ended up with DC Comics instead like he was originally intended.
===
1. Ian McKellen as Magneto
2. Liv Schriber as Victor Creed
3. Wade Wilson as Deadpool
4. Kelsey Grammer as Beast https://t.co/EXXGUYiA8P
===
@GailSimone @Shudder Don‚Äôt forget that Halfway To Halloween EXCLUDES the other stuff coming outside of their Shudder exclusives. Of particular interest is the Val Lewton collection. 7 films!! Cat People, The Seventh Victim, Leopard Man!! Scroll below the Halfway stuff

https://t.co/E2TjiCRpIx
===
@GailSimone My top *three* are Professor X, Magneto, and Deadpool, but I can't think of a fourth.
===
@GailSimone @VancityReynolds Yes! Same. He was born for the role.
===
@GailSimone I don't have a top four list, but I have a *bottom* four list:

1. Halle Berry as Storm
2. Taylor Kitsch as Gambit
3. Ben Foster as Angel (niche choice it always bothered me)
4. Famke Janssen as Jean Grey/Phoenix
===
@GailSimone But you‚Äôre right...
===
@GailSimone It's time to #RestoreTheSnyderVerse #SnyderCut

@GailSimone Curious to know where do you rank  the Cyclops actor then? @GailSimone  üòé

@GailSimone What are the chances Clifford the Big Red Dog makes an appearance?
===
Spill Gail, don't be shy üëÄ spill https://t.co/9khPs0kaTY
===
@GailSimone I loved him in the role. Here's my controversial opinion: Apart from Deadpool, SirPatStew as Prof X and both Magnetos, he's the best casting in the Fox-Marvelverse.

Also love Beetz as Domino,  the CG Colossus and Hu as Lady Deathstrike.
===
@StayAtHomeJeff @GailSimone I don't know if anyone has told you this yet but your beard is shaped like fire.
===
@DinoHunter1138 @GailSimone Hmmm... Kong appears to be the good guy here, so, obviously, I‚Äôm rooting for Godzilla.

@GailSimone Tomorrow night for me.  Boyfriend can‚Äôt stay up that late.

@GailSimone Really?  Let‚Äôs ask Cyclops or Gambit if they think you‚Äôre nice!

@canadiEmma @GailSimone There was yelling in our house when he dropped that one.

@AlyssaDepow 
Does Computerboy64 do BFDI Requests?

@AlyssaDepow I think it must have been a glitch

@thatpetewoods @GailSimone He also said ‚Äúa seventeen year old woman‚Äù ummmm that would be ‚Äòchild‚Äô
===
@GailSimone Loved him as Nightcrawler. Wish he was given more to work with. https://t.co/zg687W0suf

@thatpetewoods @GailSimone Yeah ... "I want $25mil or I go to the press. If something happens to me, I have friends with keys to lockers in a train station who will send copies to the press. Check and mate."

Gail, you can't leave us hanging https://t.co/yJUR4noAaX

@GailSimone It's true. Plus he has a totally inappropriately hilarious name... Allan. ü§£ Gets me everytime.

@GailSimone I think you mean Gambit.

@thatpetewoods @GailSimone Noticed that too.
===
@ZigsYerUncle @GailSimone he played it too sophisticated for me. i like my logan savage.

@GailSimone I'm *trying* to make a comic. One day!
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone His mutant power? Dat ass.
===
@track1971 @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone @lancecjohnson Do it anyway Linda. If he dumps you because you didn't leave a guy to bleed to death by the side of the road he wasn't good enough for you anyway!
===
@GailSimone My husband and I aren't gamers, but when you got your box from @RavensburgerNA the Disney Villainous games piqued our interest. We loved it and now own every expansion + the Marvel one! Thanks for sharing!
===
@GailSimone He was a great choice for the role. I wish they had done more with him. He has this dark, awkward loner aura about him, but still comes across as genuinely sweet. But these movies only really wanted to use Nightcrawler because his powers looked cool.
===
@GailSimone Oh, no! Sorry, Gail! ‚òπ
===
@GailSimone SAME! But I'll be by myself. I like the idea of snacks though!
===
@paulbrislen @GailSimone i dunno what that is
===
@GailSimone is it a corpse? did they send you a lil' corpse?
===
@paulbrislen @GailSimone oh, din't watch that
===
@GailSimone He was the X-iest.

About to watch tonight AGAIN https://t.co/5MzjFLEwsL

@GailSimone Allan Cumming is the reason I fell in love with the character. You‚Äôll get no argument from me.

@GailSimone Oh boy now I want to know more

@GailSimone Will you let us know in the morning whether Kong has concussive eye beams?

@GailSimone I‚Äôm not going to be up at 3 am EST, but I will watch it tomorrow morning with a bowl of cereal.

@GailSimone I think the Snyder cut would be a good lead into Injustice Gods among us, at least by what the ending seemed to be...
===
@GailSimone You people don‚Äôt know when Gail is pulling your chain yet? üòÇ
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone No Nightwing is the Falcon‚Äôs bird. You‚Äôre thinking of Night Nurse

@GailSimone SO EXCITED FOR IT!!!!!

@GailSimone YES!!!!! I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING IT TONIGHT TOO!!!!!!!!!!
===
Whose that artist on spider-man? It's in all promotional kids said but I've never seen mention of the artist? https://t.co/aU4C6nIbib
===
@tonyjudge @GailSimone He‚Äôs clearly in mid-BAMF in that shot.
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone Iceman, Beast, Angel, and Cyclops were the original members. Jean Gray joined on the first issue. That was the original X-Men. Wolverine didn‚Äôt show up till 100 issues later. Wolverine first appeared in The Incredible Hulk comic and he was not in X-Men then either.
===
@GailSimone Are kaiju snacks like...gargantuan chips?
===
@GailSimone üòÅ‚öõÔ∏èü•∞ I‚Äòm betting it was a Choi-ce call to take!

@heero_yuy2 @marvwolfman @GailSimone @hbomax Must...save....Mothra!
===
@GailSimone I REFUSE TO ARGUE WITH YOU.
===
@GailSimone X-23 will always be my favorite. She's just so much more interesting than that male clone of her they eventually shoehorned into the comics. https://t.co/u0MboFQxig
===
@GailSimone What‚Äôs a kaiju snack? Are they made from kaiju? Or snacks kaiju would eat? Because the latter is people.
===
@fangirlingjess @GailSimone THAT would be telling!
===
@GailSimone Bad news! They resolve their issues without any physical violence!
===
@GailSimone You sure that looks more gen 13

@TheEricGoldman @GailSimone BUT DO THEY KISS?

@ZenOfDesign @GailSimone Cap and the Strike Team raiding the SHIELD boat in Civil War beats it, I think.

@GailSimone What are the defining qualities of kaiju snacks?
===
@GailSimone Anything you didn't know that you're able to share?
===
@GailSimone Mine too!
===
@GailSimone Midnight ET or PT? Or is there a time warp involved and it‚Äôs actually both?
===
@GailSimone Are you all binging #SkullIsland, #Godzilla , and #KingOfTheMonsters first?? (We Are!)
===
@HGandMyka @GailSimone Miniature humans. She will spit out the clothes after consuming
===
@martincasaus This is @GailSimone-level trolling.
===
@SylentWulf81 @widely_ranged @GailSimone Yep that's Wolverine with the rocket launcher before Darkseid swapped his wings for his more famous claws.
===
@GailSimone That's 'cos you have taste.

(And yeah, it took me a couple to remember there was a team before his, lol)
===
@FieldOfInquiry @GailSimone Religious Nightcrawler is some kind of sin.
I don't mean having him be practising. I mean having him take holy orders.
Kurt is a sex symbol, &amp; they should have stuck with that.
===
@CharlesJohnDaw2 @GailSimone OK, it's a long list, but this will do for a start:

1st team: Prof X, Cyke, Jeannie, Iceman, Beast, Angel, Mimic (rip), Havok, Polaris

2nd team: Cyke again, Thunderbird (rip), Banshee, Logan, Nightcrawler, Colossus, Storm

Then it kind of changed one by one...
===
@RyanDunlavey @GailSimone '80's kids know
===
@CharlesJohnDaw2 @GailSimone Also it depends on the continuity. In at least one timeline, Firestar was an early member. In most, she wasn't an X-Man at all until the school hired her as an adult.
===
@GailSimone You‚Äôre going to love it.

===
@jaksplat @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Damn, now I rely want to write in KG.

Either make him the ratings manager, or make a literal Rage Cage like in the old Hulk cartoon.

Hmm trying to remember, but I think Hulk shows up in a Planet Hulk-style callback.
===
@jaksplat @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone The real shame is that was one of around *25* limited series (4 concurrent) in a shared Marvel/Videogame crossover universe I created in an unexpected weeklong+ trance.

&amp; I know no one that could make it happen will ever see it or care. üòí

It'll wind up in fanfic hell, at best.
===
@TheDemonClown @widely_ranged @GailSimone I stopped paying attention to Jordan White's Twitter altogether because of the incessant trolling. Whatever the credentials, there comes a point where it just stops being entertaining.
===
@GailSimone Gail no
===
@GailSimone I think he was the best casting choice.

Only arguement I have
===
@GailSimone @Meganfangirl No need your correct. https://t.co/cKAq5FX2Sw
===
@GailSimone I gotta go: 

1) Patrick Stewart as Xavier
2) Ian McKellen be as Magneto
3) Kelsey Grammer as Beast
4) Olivia Munn as Psylocke

I know the last 2 were stuck in bad movies but given better material they'd've killed!
===
@GailSimone Love him.
I knew the Bride (with Nick Lowe)
Did you ever hear the Stiffs Live album?
Costello, Nick Lowe, Wreckless Eric, Ian Drury.  Amazing.
===
@GailSimone That the one with the claws?
===
@GailSimone My list would almost be the same, but Kelsey Grammer as Beast was criminally underused and deserves a top spot, imo.
===
@GailSimone I will never not watch this clip whenever it shows up in my timeline
===
@Alabaonajin @Joe_Newark @GailSimone Yeah. Yep you are totally right.
===
@GailSimone You should contact Zack about making more content for that universe, I would love to see you two working together üëÄ
===
@RPHutch1975 @GailSimone To think, what might never have been if Cockrum had gotten them to publish The Outsiders.
===
@GailSimone Awesome bargain.

@HumanityPlague @GailSimone You wanna argue with Gail, that's on you.

@GailSimone Gail has noticed that X-Twitter is susceptible to some light targeted prodding.

@matches29029133 @Joe_Newark @GailSimone Sounds logical except i dont think Manhunter can be in two places at same time. At the flamethrower scene Swanwick was at the Pentagon. In MoS during the Youre Not alone scene Martha was in Smallville while he was back at the war room

Sorry, @GailSimone, X-Men launched in 1963.  Nightcrawler would be introduced in Giant Sized X-Men 1 in 1975.  The All-New, All-Different X-Men. https://t.co/ajJq60U8Ws

===
@GailSimone Cyclops, though I think he's different now.
===
@VileSlay @GailSimone OH MAN! thanks for posting this.üôè 
Would feel nostalgia again!
===
@Coyotespaw @starfishncoffee @GailSimone In that vein... yes.  There's a certain weight to his presence and timbre to his voice that just fits.  A wholesome patriarchal vibe that would work so well.
===
@Coyotespaw @starfishncoffee @GailSimone He needs to head up a family in a well-written streaming rugged American period drama. He'd be great in that.
===
@Coyotespaw @starfishncoffee @GailSimone Anthony Mackie I could see pulling it off... I personally think Seb should go for darker roles.  There's something about his acting style that just really settles into psychopath well.
===
@JoshuaGoji @marvwolfman @GailSimone @hbomax You do realize that was a cartoony interpretation of Godzilla and was not meant to be taken seriously?
===
@GailSimone Somewhere, at least one of the rubes is screaming "DAVE MATTHEWS!!!" and that knowledge pleases me...
===
@GailSimone I have had a massive crush in Nightcrawler since he (and the rest of the X-Men) was captured by Arcade and Dr. Doom.
===
@MaddieManges Well, please be quick and make a full body image of Mikoto Uchiha so I can make Unity Mikoto for the Naruto version of Care Bears!

@MaddieManges Well, please be quick and make a full body image of Emiru so I can make Tranquility Heart Emiru for the Naruto version of Care Bears!
===
@MaddieManges What about Black Lives Matter Bear?
===
@MsGo @starfishncoffee @GailSimone I get it, but I think it would sound sexier from Sebastian Stan: or Anthony Mackie.
===
@starfishncoffee @MsGo @GailSimone Little House on the Prairie remake?
===
@GailSimone This is correct. I loved him as Nightcrawler.
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôd actually say the same thing about James Marsden and Cyclops but I‚Äôm also a big Cyclops fan, so my bias is showing.

@JoshuaXManuel @GailSimone We do have some songs this upcoming season... üéº

@GailSimone I really like the Squadron Supreme.

That's it. That's the tweet.

@GailSimone I loved Kurt and his character story. He, Storm and Kitty had some of the best character and story development among the X-Men

@GailSimone Mine is Lightning Lad

@GailSimone I need to do awesome hair like Gail so people will send me cool stuff as well.

@GailSimone They were terribly misused but Olivia Munn as Psylocke and Lara Condor as Jubilee were perfect

@GailSimone Ur thinking of Night Thrasher https://t.co/BAsPOww6Ij
===
@GailSimone Easily the brightest spot of the weakest film in the original trilogy of films https://t.co/6qbaxOUS0T
===
@GailSimone I love Saturn Girl
===
@track1971 @BiaKing93 @GailSimone @TomTaylorMade I thought Hat Guy was Tom King?
===
@GailSimone im sure other people have asked, thoughts on the superman &amp; loia CW series?
===
@JEffinghamBellw @GailSimone In her bear days she's the Furminator.
===
@GailSimone You know Gail is a nice, proper lady because only a nice, proper lady could have written this panel. https://t.co/03IDMG1nne
===
@GailSimone Oh thank you so much!
===
@SylentWulf81 @widely_ranged @GailSimone Same well actually... nicely done
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone You‚Äôre way off, homie
===
@GailSimone The narrator: seven hours had passed and he had yet to start his thirteenth viewing like he said he would
===
@matches29029133 @GailSimone &amp; they worked for Lex iirc, so they may have known... He told Bruce his mother would be proud... Martha Wayne too? ‚ÄúWhy did you say that name!‚Äù #MarthaManhunter
===
@GailSimone Allan Cumming is amazing. Nightcrawler was criminally misused in the film, but Allan was superb. Nightcrawler is one of my favorite X-men and he was absolutely fantastic. https://t.co/qAUHZhFTfG
===
@GailSimone Ugh I haven't really seen anyone dislike his casting.  Is that a thing that people say?  I've legit never seen anyone hate on him
===
@Wiswell This feels like a question for @GailSimone
===
@GailSimone @Shudder You have good taste! One of  my favorite channels too!
===
@GailSimone The White House sequence - opening of X2 is INCREDIBLE. I love the hell out of that movie.
===
@GailSimone Killing with kindness......
===
@DowagerMitzi @GailSimone ... I never realized it but I guess I do this too.
===
@GailSimone His intro scene attacking the White House was amazing. He definitely was one of the best cast X-Men.
===
@MsGo @GailSimone There was this from Wizard magazine in 1995. https://t.co/x7oS0YbSX0
===
@JEffinghamBellw @GailSimone "Shearer o'Connor? Come with me if you want to live... without split ends."
===
@GailSimone You and Tom Taylor should just fight and get it over with. 

My money is on the non-bear person.
===
@GailSimone That‚Äôs great! I‚Äôm excited about the new season of Creepshow!
===
@JEffinghamBellw @GailSimone I believe you mean bearstyling days.
===
@GailSimone I don't know if anybody has shown you these before, but the dice goblin in me has just spent $200 on a set of electronic dice. (You still have 8 days before the kickstarter closes)

https://t.co/MGplZ67fly
===
@GailSimone Hey, just thought I'd share that if you're looking for a cheap gift for RPG nerds, this game is basically 1 giant D12, 5 giant D6s AND a dice bag for less than $9! https://t.co/BXUquZsN3K

@JEffinghamBellw @GailSimone ‚ÄúCome with me if you want no friz‚Äù üòé

@GailSimone @VancityReynolds Absolutely

@GailSimone This is üíØ truth. Hand to the gods!
===
@GailSimone Fassbenbender was brilliant. Especially in first class, I feel they wasted him in the sequels which was such a 'shame'
===
@GailSimone Depending on the day (or even the time of day!),  you either the T100 Terminator that tried to kill Sarah Connor or the repurposed T100 Terminator in T2 who tried to protect him.
===
@EwaSR @GailSimone Nightcrawler is SO PERFECT and SO PRECIOUS

@GailSimone Chicks (and everyone else) dig the blue fuzzy dude.

@GailSimone I picked this up from ours back in the fall. Mind was blown when I saw it on the shelves. https://t.co/MWV5Fs6arO

Nothing to argue with, 100% in agreement here. -Cole https://t.co/TGxkJ57NHK
===
@GailSimone Not going to argue with you but you're wrong, because he sucked.
===
@GailSimone Was it a Tea Dragon? They are the best and I love them.
===
@GailSimone He was so good.
===
@SPAZmanJones @GailSimone @Shudder You simply bury it under your floorboards and try to ignore the heartbeat only you can hear
===
@GailSimone These, yes, but at the top is Kelsey Grammar as Dr. Hank McCoy
===
I think both versions of Magneto were perfect. https://t.co/EzxXBuBKbX
===
@GailSimone @Shudder GAIL, DON'T OPEN MYSTERY BOXES FROM THE HORROR PEOPLE, IT IS FULL OF ORGANS
===
@LarryDixonTGK @Greymattersplat @GailSimone @Shudder @elijahwood I mean.. I think she has a @RocketSpouse who may or may not have real cannibal action.. and she's a bear.. she can't use an Elijah Wood :P
===
@GailSimone A) Gail is a bear. B) Gail is a nice bear. C) Gail is clearly a.... twittenator. As she only tweets people to death, not actually murders them.
===
@Greymattersplat @GailSimone @Shudder @elijahwood If it is.. forward it my way..please and thank you. I know you can't use one. You have enough already lol.
===
@GailSimone "I'm nice." https://t.co/bK1Ue01J9x
===
@GailSimone Yes, you are. Also, evil. These are not mutually exclusive things.
===
@GailSimone These are not mutually exclusive.
===
@GailSimone Terminice? Terminally delightful?
===
@GailSimone I'm now trying to reconcile the knowledge that we've been robbed of the most terrifying of antagonists - a bear terminator. How many sequels have they wasted!? How many more will pass before we get a true glimpse into the horror of the future?
===
@GailSimone and that's why we ask: @wbpictures #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
===
@fearofmonkeys @GailSimone Nah, I think she meant she just genuinely loves the film. Unclear tho.
===
@lachwriter @tteacayy @d_rawcrystal @LetterSquids @GailSimone @FellHound_ @frankee_white @kirameks @sambeckdraws @BenTheKahn @cloudwrangler @ChrisShehanArt @xXAutumnIvyXx @PeaceLoveComics CONGRATULATIONS!!!

I TOLD YOU!!!
===
@GailSimone Hello officer? I'd like to report the perfect murder.
===
@GailSimone Fascinating. I bought the Kindle version of Billy Crystal's autobiography today for $1.99. I think you got the better deal, tho.

This is true. https://t.co/epj6QxPhrw

===
@GailSimone The Who encyclopedia is a bargain.  The other might be a rip-off.
===
@GailSimone She cannot be reasoned with, she cannot be deflected, and she will never, ever stop.

Gail Simone is a terminator.
===
@GailSimone No, you're right. Allan Cumming as Nightcrawler was amazing.
===
@GailSimone Well, did you see Arnold in ‚ÄúDark Fate‚Äù?
===
@GailSimone Bamf!
===
@GailSimone She is merciless. But, also a very good writer.
===
@JanArrah @Greymattersplat @GailSimone @Shudder @elijahwood @RocketSpouse Nah, that's more of a 5-iron shot. Definitely shouldn't use a Wood.
===
@GailSimone Back in her hairstyling days Gail was known as the Perminator
===
@GailSimone She‚Äôs a terminator bear‚Äî-a Terminategrrrrr.
===
@GailSimone So you're T2 Terminator.

The best Terminator.

Hardly a surprise.
===
@12MileGeo @GailSimone She doesn‚Äôt understand pity or remorse!
===
@BrousseLaine @BiaKing93 @GailSimone @TomTaylorMade Look how thirsty Kitty is üò≠üòÇ
===
@GailSimone i thought you were a bear üëÄ
===
@GailSimone @MagpieOfficial @CalliopeGames @TheOpGames @atlasgames Shut up. No I‚Äôm not serious, just jealous. Dangit.
===
@GailSimone A teddy Bear.
===
@GailSimone Wait.... could this be a replacement for cena?
===
@GailSimone Monty Python's Flying Circus?
===
@GailSimone I liked Sumela Kay as Kitty Pryde.
===
@kuhnarchitekt @GailSimone Same.
===
@kuhnarchitekt @GailSimone You know some people with entirely too much money are going to try to snatch a pair and wear em out because what can nike do then?
===
@GailSimone I thought he was perfect, not crazy about the scarification though
===
@jess_in_la @GailSimone And I don't see the big deal in either case. Name your shoes whatever you want - the cool kids will know what's up.
===
@GailSimone Satan shoes? If so, dammit I want some.
===
@jess_in_la @GailSimone Honestly? I thought Nike made them &amp; thought it was odd after that whole "succubus" shoe mess a few years back.
===
@GailSimone I didn't think that X-Men 3 was particularly good, but Kelsey Grammer as Beast was inspired casting.
===
This is 100% accurate. https://t.co/nqKwQf48Uo
===
@GailSimone My only question is, what do you think the first best casting was?

The answer: https://t.co/Fe80wHVH8b
===
@GailSimone @VancityReynolds This list is spot-on. I'd go:
1. Patrick Stewart as Professor X
2. Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool
3. Alan Cummings as Nightcrawler
===
@GailSimone @VancityReynolds So in terms of, "Spot-On Comic Book Casting in the X-Men Films," I'd say the Top 5 goes:
1. @SirPatStew (Professor X)
2. @VancityReynolds (Deadpool)
3. @Alancumming (Nightcrawler)
4. @KelseyGrammer (Beast)
5. James Marsden (Cyclops)
===
@GailSimone @VancityReynolds Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, &amp; James McAvoy are all tremendous in those films, but they are very unique, non-comics based interpretations of those characters.

Though underused, James Marsden as Cyclops &amp; Kelsey Grammer as Beast are perfect.
===
@GailSimone @Shudder OMG I love this.üòÅüíú
===
@GailSimone I would never argue with you.
===
@GailSimone Wasn‚Äôt he in the Legion of Superheroes first?
===
@KurtBusiek @GailSimone A candle that smells like Gwyneth Paltrow's head?
===
@GailSimone You‚Äôre right and you should say it
===
@GailSimone @Shudder It's time for some spooky snacks
===
@GailSimone It ‚Äúis wrapped in plastic like Laura Palmer.‚Äù

I probably shouldn‚Äôt have laughed out loud at that...but I did. ü§£
===
@daveweter @GailSimone I hope those come with a bio-hazard warning.
===
@MeadraJim @daveweter @GailSimone It‚Äôs so weird on so many levels. I don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs legal.
===
@MeadraJim @GailSimone It‚Äôs Li‚Äôl Laura Palmer, the Tiny Twin Peaks Corpse. üòÜ
===
@GailSimone @Shudder I need chocolate. Nom nom nom.
===
@MeadraJim @GailSimone YES THERE IS

https://t.co/VJDOau0VZN
===
@MeadraJim @GailSimone Cheaper on eBay.

https://t.co/0Pxu14WGFx
===
@guts_nelson @GailSimone I guffawed. Honestly, I‚Äôm still laughing.

I‚Äôm going straight to hell for sure. ü§£
===
@GailSimone A Cadbury‚Äôs SCREAM EGG? How have I never heard of this evil treasure?
===
@GailSimone My favorite thing about Nightcrawler is how he can only move on all fours after dark
===
@ToweringClam @GailSimone @Shudder I knew Green was sus.

@GailSimone Absolute bargain!

@GailSimone @Shudder I need those Peeps!!!

@GailSimone thoughts? https://t.co/jgQrPNTBZ9

@GailSimone @Shudder JOE BOB BRIGGS!!!!
===
@GailSimone What would be the first?
===
@GailSimone @Shudder THE FRANKENPEEPS üòç
===
@GailSimone Fassbender is the beginning and end of my favorite X-Men casting. I don‚Äôt have the ability to move past his Magneto.
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôve listened to the audiobook of Still Foolin Em, its sooooo good.
===
@GailSimone @Shudder Oh snap! We are now excited for April!
===
@graemem @GailSimone @hbomax Didn't WW84 have a noon drop?
===
@GailSimone @craigengler @Shudder You're awesome! https://t.co/TivT6whoFb
===
@GSBCE1of4 @GailSimone Ooo, is there a Laura Palmer Funko Pop?
===
@GSBCE1of4 @GailSimone Well, yeah, I'm just wondering if it's ACTUALLY Laura Palmer in there. Could be. It's Shudder, after all.
===
@daveweter @KurtBusiek @GailSimone It's now the wasp nest, I think.
===
@GSBCE1of4 @daveweter @GailSimone If those actually have a drop of human blood in them, I shall eat a bug. Well, I sometimes back with cricket flour, so technically that's not a sacrifice, but, still.
===
@GailSimone That's freaking adorable and I was kind of right by guessing a type of snack, lol.
===
@GailSimone Cookies? An attack bear? Another table top game?
===
@GailSimone They're *my* original X-Men also.
===
@GailSimone A stapler?
===
In case you needed a reminder of what April represents! https://t.co/eVJwRnIoQD
===
@GailSimone The day that nobody bites on one of these is the day sexism is fixed.
===
@Thrabalen @widely_ranged @GailSimone Professor X started a privately funded aerospace company. He gave rise to the Fantastic Four.
===
@GailSimone @wildbill @Shudder Definitely start at the beginning. It's great!
===
@GailSimone Peeps but the heads have been cut off. Just a way out there guess.ü§£
===
@GailSimone If there are those orange peanut shaped candies in there it's a real horror show.
===
@GailSimone Bubble wrap! Popping time.
===
@GailSimone I sting from the missed opportunity of not casting @ImAngelaBassett as Storm. From the first time I saw her on film, I knew she would make a hell of a Storm.

No problem with your list but Evan Peters did bring something to Pietro.
===
@GailSimone I can't argue. üòä
===
@GailSimone an Easter basket/Creepshow promo?
===
@GailSimone dude I got it right
===
@zippomage @GailSimone IT'S A MOTHERBOX
===
@zippomage @GailSimone The Snyder Cut is all over it.
===
@GailSimone omg i would give my left tiddy for a halfway to halloween basket
===
@GailSimone Holy cow this rules!
===
@GailSimone I don‚Äôt understand why the movies kept making Kurt a brooding loner instead of being more swashbuckling and warm. Nightcrawlers personality is one of the best parts about him.
===
@GailSimone Dammit, I was going to guess that someone had shipped you an Olicity.
===
@GailSimone I need to know! we all do! https://t.co/wm9UYl4hFT
===
@GailSimone Mine is Green Lantern.
===
@GailSimone It's a bear, isn't it?

Gail woke up today and chose to create chaos... Doing the best version of "a shark's skin is smooth" and everyone blowing up over it. https://t.co/cVoc96apoa
===
@GailSimone Monty Python's Flying Circus?
===
@ThatTupperKid @GailSimone Was it marked FRA-GEE-LAY? :D
===
@GailSimone @Shudder Anywhere! It‚Äôs a ‚Äúmovie of the week‚Äù format, hosted by @therealjoebob and @kinky_horror. They have commentary, trivia, and interviews where commercial breaks would be, and they pull movies from all over the horror genre, from incredible to bonkers. Love it.
===
@GailSimone @Shudder I am waiting with bated breath to see what you got! I love Shudder too - are you a fan of #TheLastDriveIn? #MutantFam
===
@GailSimone A Major Award?
===
@GailSimone Delicious foods? ü§î
===
@GailSimone No argument.
===
@GailSimone Who is the bear
And the kaiju
And the porch?
WHO IS YOUR TRENDING TOPIC,
NOW AND FOREVER?!?

@GailSimone Is. https://t.co/3oSydOwbX4
===
@GailSimone I'm a comic book fan. I was an office PA on X2. I was confused by the choice until I saw the performance. He. Was. Great!
===
@GailSimone It‚Äôs too small for a whole human head, my heads is a couple of hands. Maybe a foot.
===
@KurtBusiek @GailSimone The head is no longer the most shipped Gwyneth Paltrow body part.
===
@GailSimone Did you buy the Satan shoes that Little Nas X is selling?
===
@IanBoothby @GailSimone When Harry Met Sally Sparrow
===
@GailSimone @wildbill @Shudder It's in the "original series" section on Shudder.
===
@GailSimone Gwyneth‚Äôs Paltrow‚Äôs head?

Again?
===
@GailSimone "is wrapped in plastic like Laura Palmer."

M A ' A M
===
@docbeechler @GailSimone That's it.
===
@GailSimone I somehow almost fell for this bait.
===
@GailSimone A piece of Gwyneth Paltrow?
===
@GailSimone @Shudder Human head!
===
@GailSimone my guess is a remote control that doubles as a murder weapon.
===
@GailSimone Bargain! I got one of those books too, plus these DVD‚Äôs. https://t.co/S5GSsOIAtg
===
@GailSimone She runs on pixie dust, spice melange, and good old fashioned moonshine.
===
@GailSimone His performance made me a fan of the character. Beforehand I was kind of so-so about Nightcrawler.
===
@GailSimone I got nothing...
===
@GailSimone He‚Äôs so so so so good.
===
@GailSimone Reading 'Domino: Killer Instinct'

LOL
===
@GailSimone Oooooo I got the whoniverse one at the dollar store too! Definitely a bargain for that one
===
@GailSimone @Shudder Your Magic Porch brings me such vicarious joy. May it be ever bountiful.
