@WSJ and President Biden signed the distribution of aid for US economic growth and recovery and to accelerate the vaccination campaign during the first 100 days in power, the United States gets out of the neck of the Corona pandemic.

However, the largest share of the epidemic is in the level of total GDP, manufacturing and trade
In contrast to the recent global financial crisis,
===
@WSJ and disadvantaged groups who bear the greatest burden of the social, health and economic impacts of the virus around the world. It is difficult to gauge the true economic impacts of the Covid-19 epidemic in a rapidly changing environment, especially at the level of production,
===
@WSJ The Covid-19 pandemic is too big to be confined to a health crisis, as it is a humanitarian catastrophe that leads to changes and transformations that have attacked the heart of societies and their economies. Evidence already indicates that it is the poor

@EmmanuelMacron It prevents you from spreading the Covid-19 virus to others
The number of vaccinated community members increases the incidence of Covid 19 - which slows the spread of the disease and contributes to herd immunity (so-called herd immunity)

@EmmanuelMacron The vaccine is useful and everyone should take this vaccine because it protects you from contracting Covid 19 or from getting seriously ill or dying due to Covid 19

@WSJ @POTUS Before 1949, the Chinese economic foundation was very weak, and it lacked an integrated industrial system. Agricultural products, raw materials and natural resources constituted the bulk of foreign trade, which lacked an independent system. For example, before 1949,
===
@WSJ In the future, China will continue to expand international economic openness and cooperation, participate in economic globalization, realize mutual benefit and share win-win fruits with trading partners.
===
@WSJ China has become a great global trading power in the last 70 years, but it has not yet become a strong trading nation.
===
@WSJ Foreign-funded enterprises brought with them advanced machinery and equipment, as well as management concepts and technical personnel, which helped China quickly integrate into the global production system, and contributed to the rapid growth of China's foreign trade.
===
@WSJ their share in China's total exports increased from 0.04% in 1980 to 58.3% in 2005. Since 2006, the ratio of foreign-funded companies' exports to total Chinese exports has been declining. But the percentage is still high, in 2018, it was 41.7%.
===
@WSJ It should be emphasized that foreign direct investment has played a decisive role in promoting the rapid recovery and development of China's foreign trade. Exports of foreign-funded companies in China have increased rapidly since the start of reform and opening-up:
===
@WSJ the structure of China's import and export has also improved continuously, indicating that China is on the way to transforming from a large trading nation into a powerful trading nation.
===
@WSJ it can help underdeveloped countries and regions improve infrastructure, accelerate economic development and create job opportunities. For example, Chinese investment in Africa helped 100,000 Africans find jobs. While the total volume of foreign trade has increased rapidly,
===
@WSJ which strongly supported China's economic development. The accumulated foreign exchange also allows China to invest abroad. With these foreign investments, on the one hand, China can learn from advanced technologies and overseas management experiences, and on the other hand,
===
@WSJ From 1990 to 2018, China maintained a trade surplus. Foreign trade enabled China to increase its foreign exchange reserves, thus financing its imports of advanced technologies and equipment, as well as bringing in prominent foreign specialists and technicians,
===
@WSJ China It will give more powers to pilot free trade zones to conduct reform, and to explore opening free trade ports. These reform measures have greatly promoted the development of China's foreign trade.
===
@WSJ China agreed to establish 12 pilot free trade zones, from 2013 to 2018. In October 2017, Chinese President Xi Jinping indicated in the report submitted to the Nineteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China that
===
@WSJ and by September 2015, their number had reached 219. Since the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, China has been opening up to the outside world. In order to comply with international trade rules and standards,
===
@WSJ China has agreed to open up 15 coastal cities with partial decision-making powers in foreign trade. In open coastal cities, from 1984 to 1986, China established 14 national economic and technological development zones, counting that, the number of these areas increased,
===
@WSJ industrial raw materials replaced machinery and equipment to represent the largest proportion of China's imports, and after the sixties its share rose to 50% with the improvement of the industrial system,
===
@WSJ which played an important role in establishing and restoring the Chinese industrial system. From 1953 to 1962, the percentage of machinery and equipment in imports was 40%. From 1972 to 1977, China imported 222 technologies,
===
@WSJ In November 1949, China established the Ministry of Commerce, which carried out foreign trade activities as well. In December 1950, China promulgated the Temporary Regulations for Foreign Trade, and later the Temporary Customs Law.
===
@WSJ there were only about 4,600 domestic foreign trade companies in the various ports of China, employing about 35,000 people, and the total capital of 130 million yuan. The number of large companies with a capital of more than one hundred thousand yuan was very little.
===
@WSJ the CPC Central Committee and the State Council decided to create four special economic zones in Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou and Xiamen. In April 1988, Hainan Province was added as a special economic zone. Since then,
===
@WSJ Foreign trade has played a major role in promoting industrial production in China. China imported a large amount of machinery and equipment, introduced many advanced technologies, and imported many industrial raw materials and spare parts,
===
@WSJ From 1950 to 1959, China's national economy and industrial production recovered and developed gradually, as did foreign trade. The fledgling People's Republic of China sought to establish an independent foreign trade system.
===
@WSJ and foreign trade has entered a path of rapid growth and structural modernization. To promote the development of foreign trade, China has gradually implemented the policy of opening up to the outside world, from coastal regions to regions within China. In May 1980,
===
@WSJ machines and equipment from more than ten developed countries such as the United States of America and Japan, for a value of $ 1.96 billion. Industrial raw materials accounted for a high proportion of China's imports. From the beginning of the sixties of the last century,
===
@WSJ an increase of five times and with an average annual growth rate of 10.79%; The volume of imports increased from 2.3 billion US dollars to 10.89 billion US dollars, an increase of five times, with an average annual growth rate of 11.02%.
===
@WSJ the comparative advantages of China's exports also changed, and the structure of exports witnessed a continuous improvement. From 1953 to 1970, the proportion of manufactured industrial goods in China's total exports rose from 2.11% to 10.5% in the 1970s.
===
@WSJ This percentage continued to increase, and reached 45.3% in 1978.
In general, China's foreign trade in the 30 years before reform and opening-up has achieved remarkable results in recovery, development and structural improvement.
===
@WSJ In 1952, China established the Ministry of Foreign Trade to manage foreign trade business in a centralized and unified manner, check and standardize the registration of various foreign trade enterprises, and implement classified management of import and export commodities.
===
@WSJ In 1978, the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to shift its focus to economic construction. China has entered a new era of reform and opening-up,
===
@POTUS @mPinoe @100Purcent The head of the largest country in the world imminent transformation did not take effect. His Excellency the President intervened to put an end to this unjustified recklessness
===
@WSJ From 1950 to 1959, the total volume of China's imports and exports increased from 1.1 billion US dollars to 4.38 billion US dollars, and the volume of its exports increased from 550 million US dollars to 2.26 billion US dollars, to 9.75 billion US dollars,

3 days laterr.. now that i'm done with diablo i'll do this https://t.co/M682oieHsH
===
@biancalovebot WHY ARE YOU MAD ABOUT IT
===
and the everlasting of keeping delphine or ditching her because of attachment
===
thinking abt his demon form and about the whole pact thing
===
@DOLLYDOLCl hi ! let's talk about ur ocs!!! what do u have in mind?
===
kicks a bucket ah wtf i might just write it all rn
===
fankids while i was making this i was thinking we need a pixie hollow rp.. not like "daughter/apprentice of" style but just fairies (๑°꒵°๑) https://t.co/IGYEkrQNs0
===
good moenkngzz thinks abt fairy!! think I'll only have max 2 fairies in this rp
===
@SANRXO wouldn't be as fun without you 👯
===
@biancalovebot hii i'm pretty sure it wouldn't! because in the contract it states the soul bearer has to sell it in their own free will and fully conscious so it would be break of contract! and i thiink the person's soul leaves their body to accommodate his too so!
===
i want to do it mainly for 

glina x delphine
wolfgang x glina
eldora x carmen
carmen x sasha
how diablo, indigo and donovan differ among themselves because i feel like they can come off as the same
===
@voItageous play the kakegurui intro LETS GET OUR GAMBLING FREAK ON
===
@biancalovebot join me then silly !!
===
i thought it would be cool if diablo had a snake tongue but i think it would make things hard for him to speak
===
@DOLLYDOLCl aww :( do u think you'll get back on it anytime soon?
===
i think for donovan, draining energy is not as interesting as reality warping.. so i might make a little trade there
===
what if she died /j
===
@ghostgrrI i'm okay ! how about u?
===
hold on is donovan just freddy krueger
===
i just lied i'll do charts instead!
===
yeah
===
@biancalovebot giving limitations to his powers can help !!
===
@DOLLYDOLCl helo there's just me here rn :)
===
i think diablo's true form could be a mixture of snake and goat since i've been using that for him.. his eyes are something he can't shape shift well enough and will always give away that he's a demon
===
@azurasgf NO WAY
===
@biancalovebot THANK YOUOU he is a fucking mess &lt;3
===
looks for more charts
===
after this whole thing i wrote about diablo i can conclude he could not be more contradictory and tbh...? i love that..
===
cuz you know the nightmare also depends so much on the setting to be frightening, just as much as the thing he's gonna shift into... idk how i did not include that in his first submission
===
@azurasgf I DO . I DO INSIST
===
i said : i'll work on each character a day! it's wednesday and still on diablo
===
@ghostgrrI LET'S DO IT LET'S DO IT https://t.co/lgFvD4b1ZI
===
maybe a monologue of donovan in the library cuz i still don't know how to play him would help
===
when i study demonology just to make a monster high rp character .. a lost case
===
if i ever make another character *chuckles* i won't make another prep !! i promise !!!
===
okay /hj but like it's an eah rp.. I DON'T KNOW
===
thinking about diablo
===
@azurasgf awww come here :(( i hope working on there helps u even if a little &lt;33 and like i said i'm here for anything!! https://t.co/2kMDLEbqi7
===
i'll write a separate thing with all the info about deals later, hopefully this week still
===
and it has three names and three heads 🥰🥰🥰 https://t.co/e9C8Ne8Ejb
===
finished abilities break down WOOOO
===
i'm projeticng or whatever the kids say these days
===
i read a writing advice that said "either do it or shut up about doing it" and that's what I'll do! back on diving in diablos mind
===
diablo has a soft side omg
===
@azurasgf here for u if u need anything &lt;3 ly
===
@ghostgrrI YESSSS EVERYONE WITH THEIR LITOL FAIRIE
===
broke down all of his flaws and qualities, now onto weaknesses
===
one keeps looking down on the other because of their wealth and idk i like that
===
@ghostgrrI aww i understand completely :(( i feel like that about some of my characters too &lt;///3 it would be completely okay if u wanted to delete them!!
===
I FINISHED for now
===
i just realized demonic possession doesn't have much use for the dmeon besides being hella fun
===
@DOLLYDOLCl me wants
===
i'm thinking like a real mixture, not a half/half situation. like he could have a goat snout, with the insides of a snake mouth (tongue, venom, teeth), goat horns and different patches of fur and scale.. it sounds ugly enough for a demon
===
@ghostgrrI helloooo
===
i kind of forgot every where i had to reply to.. orz
===
@biancalovebot that's a good idea too !!!!
===
@azurasgf I DO WANT ITTTT OMG PLEASE CAN WE
===
looks at black phillip from the witch movie.. thank you i owe you so much of this character building
===
was discussing with my bf how wolfgang and glina are so alike and could be a power duo but refuse to because of social status
===
well https://t.co/WierLw8oEI
===
@MIYA1SM LET'S GOOO TEDDYY FAIRIES SSSS
===
i just lied i didn't even open that doc during all this time!! that tip doesn't work!!!!!!
===
@MeepleU Xbox game pass is awesome. I like that I can try games that I probably normally wouldn't play if I had to buy it. Definitely worth it.
===
@MeepleU 100% worth it. Just the Yakuza games alone (all of them) are worth the price. Then you have another, oh, 150 games or so to play beyond that.
===
@MeepleU Best deal in gaming right now
===
@HopeForTTRPGs @bea_dnd What they said 👆

@DCrapuchettes @NorthStarGames I'd go with the 3rd
===
@MeepleU Honestly GamePass is absurdly good value. I have the pc version of it, which is much more limited, but still totally worth it.
===
@MeepleU I love it! It's like Netflix for games 😀
===
@LGNOEpodcast @TTInquisition @TabletopGamesBl They really do like to take over 😀
===
@bgramblings @MeepleU The recent inclusion of EA and Bethesda has taken it up quite a few notches. It may seem expensive but if you're already paying for xblive then it's not a big jump to add in game pass.
===
@MeepleU Without it you may as well have bought a PlayStation.
===
@MeepleU SO worth it, and I only have it on PC.
===
@GIVEPAUSEhobby @ThinkerThemer @MeepleU @LudoPhoebe 😢 I hope the vaccine gets to you soon and it'll go away, DESPITE those top level decisions.
===
@MeepleU @ThinkerThemer @ellalovesbg @LudoCherry @boardgamebbq 🥰 Right back at you! https://t.co/uQ0NM0Ysiu
===
@MeepleU @FinalFrontierG @dr_vil Omg I thought for a second you were advertising a stream for tonight and I was like "WE'RE PLAYING GAMES TOGETHER IN 90 MINUTES WHAT ARE YOU DOING" 😂
===
@Gamefreakgeek @ThinkerThemer @MeepleU @LudoPhoebe Soooooon Monique ❤️
===
With no cases in over 2 weeks statewide, we actually got to have a NORMAL catch up with @ThinkerThemer &amp; @MeepleU tonight 🥰

At least now I can blame my social skills on a year apart... https://t.co/Z2LepG3Dpj
===
@markh110 @ThinkerThemer @MeepleU @LudoPhoebe Oh man, that looks nice! Wish I had my teleporter ready...
===
@MeepleU @markh110 @ThinkerThemer @LudoPhoebe I guess that game night would be strange, if I just suddenly entered through a portal! 😂
===
@MeepleU If you look at the games and see lots you’d like to play, then absolutely! I love it, and mostly play games that are on there. Would have to play a lot to get to the end of my list. Also, many brand new games are released there as well! 🥳
===
Excited to be part of this launch! Please join us to see playthrough of #TheGirlWhoMadeTheStars this weekend. Plus giveaway of the pledge :D

@N20Games @FinalFrontierG @dr_vil Where?!?🤣
===
@Panda8ngel Haha yep. It's been awhile since that happened to me. Like uni or high school i think. And there's video games hangovers, cant stop playing lol
===
@Madcoder8 I have not no, and I'm curious
===
@mrcoaster1 @Thenerdshelves @SitDownGames I might have given the wrong impression here, sorry! Yes this box fits in Kalax😂
===
@KosmosGamesUK Omg!🥰 My plan is to play ALL exit games
===
I've been recommended to play with VR googles a few times, have tried the early version, but got motion sickness. Is this the newer version? How are you going if you've played with them?
https://t.co/FEcolEaWPj

@dr_vil Woooot thats awesome 😍

Another digital game going to board game :)

===
@MGStogdill @EightAteEight Lol, just dont get he vaccine on the side of the...backend lol. But seriously thats great! I think my turn to get it still quote months away.
===
@SitDownGames @mrcoaster1 @Thenerdshelves 🤣 i might have mislead everyone with the giant box🙏🤣
===
@MeepleU @AnkamaGames DINOS! Enjoy! https://t.co/2f1qtPBctc
===
@MeepleU So worth it, so many games. I've spent hundreds of hours playing game pass games at this point now.
===
@MeepleU Worth it, downloaded unravel 2, phogs, star wars fallen order, fifa 20 and that's just in the first week
===
@MeepleU Yup totally worth it.
===
@MeepleU @hplbot Worth it.
===
@MeepleU @hplbot great value and a great reason to have an xbox

I would go so far as to say its a good value even if you only have a PC
===
@MeepleU I had it for a while, just doesn't have enough games to justify the price. I'd rather stick with Humble Monthly, because at least I get to keep the games
===
@markh110 @ThinkerThemer @MeepleU @LudoPhoebe Damnit, starting to have serious regrets about leaving Australia 😭
But so glad y'all are getting to celebrate!
===
@KevMeeple Sorry for your loss but glad for your many memories. We have a very similar Schnauzer and couldn't imagine life without him ❤️
===
@Gamefreakgeek @beneeta_k @1minboardgames @BraininaJar2 @PlumpyThimble @KevMeeple @RuelGaviola @PlumpyThimble is indeed great, just watched his Vamp on the Batwalk how to play last night, but I guess I've been missing out on more primo content on TikTok. I've only seen @RuelGaviola's streams, looking forward to seeing more of him 😄
===
@MeepleU 😂😂😂 video game hangovers are probably more normal
===
@MeepleU @markh110 @ThinkerThemer @LudoPhoebe I would love up fly over when it's safe!
===
@markh110 @ThinkerThemer @MeepleU @LudoPhoebe So jealous!!!
===
@KevMeeple Thanks!!
===
@KevMeeple It's for lunch tomorrow and I guarantee I'll forget it at home.
===
@ithayla Ha! Mine says 100% leans left, caused by @KevMeeple, @ithayla, and @6_isles???

Like... Does hockey count as left leaning news? How did Tom sneak into this list? How did Calvin of all people come out neutral?
===
@KevMeeple @ithayla @6_isles @Gamefreakgeek We're each other's top influencers, which means we're caught in a feedback loop. But if that feedback loop includes infinite cat and dog videos? Not so bad. https://t.co/4fvTMirXuc

===
@LGNOEpodcast I’m so excited!  2 full days of uninterrupted board games!
===
@LGNOEpodcast Arizona here!
===
@MeepleU The new MS Flight Sim is fantastic in VR.
===
@MeepleU I haven't played VR board games, but I have played a lot of VR games. The only game that made me sick was "AirCar" and only after an hour of careening around in a flying car. That said, I very very rarely get motion sick.
===
@MeepleU Yes, but you can fly around the plane outside...
===
@LGNOEpodcast Thinking of it they do look like a start of a potato. Ears are weird
===
@markh110 @ThinkerThemer @MeepleU @LudoPhoebe I wish we were there! Have lots of fun folks
===
@PlumpyThimble @Gamefreakgeek @BGFeast @1minboardgames @BraininaJar2 @KevMeeple @RuelGaviola second that!
===
@Gamefreakgeek @BGFeast @beneeta_k @1minboardgames @BraininaJar2 @KevMeeple @RuelGaviola @KevMeeple videos are incredible
===

===
@BGFeast @beneeta_k @1minboardgames @BraininaJar2 @PlumpyThimble is the OG board game TikTok homie.
@KevMeeple makes REALLY cool videos!
@RuelGaviola is wonderful everywhere he goes.
===
@LGNOEpodcast @BGInquisition @TabletopGamesBl Thank you for sharing. It's great to hear how big a role board games play in your life. My favourite is that they're also doubling up as decoration in your flat.
===
@LGNOEpodcast Haha! Which one? Disney 😝
===
@LGNOEpodcast Awww ur too kind 😍😘
===
Nope! Its now up 🤣 @LGNOEpodcast
===
@litolnymph YEAH
===
@LGNOEpodcast @eightlittlebits +1 for best fitting GIF ever! :D
===
@LGNOEpodcast Thank you! Haha
===
@lilithvanille THIS SONG FUCKING SLAPS NO CAP
===
@MeepleU As for VR sickness, dramamine helps.  Also, I tend to only get sick when my character is moving fast.  Sitting at a table in VR doesn't phase me.
===
@MeepleU I love the ability to interact with the table and feel like I'm there but until they make it more intuitive, I'm out.  

I check in on it from time to time but boy is it clunky.
===
@MeepleU I love TableTop Simulator.  I love VR.  I do not love TTS in VR.  It's a great idea but the VR controls feel like an afterthought and requires a lot of tweaking of controls.
===
@Rick_Lorenzon @LGNOEpodcast It totally does! Hahaha 🤣 I wonder if I said that to him if he still would of explained it...
===
@LGNOEpodcast Admittedly it was nice that he explained it since I’d never seen it before. It’s a bandage that they put on before the shot and they give the shot through it. Then they don’t have to do the cotton ball and put a bandaid on after.
===
@nerdoutwithus @LGNOEpodcast Kind of looks like a toilet bowl LoL

I honestly prefer them on the floor than rolling into components on the board, knocking trains off course, bamboo tumbling down, player pieces being knocked over 🤣😂

@MeepleU have you played it yet?  I think it just came out yesterday.  I'm curious to see how good it is.
===
@MeepleU I had the same issue with this and with PS VR. Putting a fan blowing on my face solved it for me though...provided I'm &lt; 5 beers into the day anyway

@markh110 @ThinkerThemer @MeepleU @LudoPhoebe Ah normal catch-ups. I remember those. I think 🤔
===
@markh110 @ThinkerThemer @MeepleU @LudoPhoebe Oh my goodness, I’m incredibly jealous (but happy for you all!). Meanwhile I’m dealing with rabid hockey families who apparently NEED MOARE SPORHTS and a school board that’s looking at slowly rising numbers and considering going fully back in person... UGH.
===
@markh110 @ThinkerThemer @MeepleU @LudoPhoebe Thanks dude! I actually just woke up from a quick nap halfway home from driving to get my second vaccine! (had to drive a bit to make it happen, but I did it!) so that’s heading in the right direction. Now to just hope against hope that poor decisions don’t outpace science 🤞😬🤞
===
@markh110 @ThinkerThemer @MeepleU @LudoPhoebe What a power group! So jealous! :)
===
@KevMeeple @PeteButtigieg This is going to be the one who responds. We can feel it.
===
@KevMeeple @PeteButtigieg Haven't seen one of these in a while.  Don't know if it's twitter being twitter or something else - but I loved the idea, thought it was clever!
