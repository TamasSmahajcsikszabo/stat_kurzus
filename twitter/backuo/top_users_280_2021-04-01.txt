You can clear this up by showing how spacetime causes the effect of the non inertial frame.

Your words: "spacetime is real, physical, tangible". Show it.
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 I have no problem with it. I do not have a religious dogma to defend as you do. I am simply telling you that what you assert is not possible, based on logical deduction applying the laws of thermodynamics, space is fake to be precise.

===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 No it's special pleading. A gas pressure cannot be maintained by a gravitational field. Except in this assertion. For which there is no evidence.

@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 A mathematical construct, thank you for the confirmation. Light bending does not indicate a gravitational field nor spacetime nor spacetime curvature. Do you know what an experiment is?

Repealing members of Congress isn’t easy as districts are drawn in their favor.

@IndieWire The movie was awful, 'your wish!' was so stupid and the CGI fest at the end isn't anything that Jenkins' wanted - it was a studio push.
===
@kt_roar @IndieWire Yeah but I mean I may have misremembered this slightly. That's the current press tour. I don't think any studio director will bad mouth their film on a current tour. Admittedly, I think WW ending the first time around is worlds better than 1984.
===
@CheezusPersonal @MSteitz468 @IndieWire Those weren't as heavily done as the 2020 election.
===
@CheezusPersonal @MSteitz468 @IndieWire The solution was to prevent voter fraud and another rigged election.
===
@SCWConnoisseur @CheezusPersonal @MSteitz468 @IndieWire Democrats and Liberals cheated last year. You have no idea how bad things truly are with Biden as an Dictator. Voted in by the politicians and NOT the American people.
===
@CheezusPersonal @MSteitz468 @IndieWire Plus, Biden is against this form of voter requirements; of which, are completely necessary. So my question is why is he wanting to stop them! Is he and Harris hiding something? Wouldn't he look into this before making a decision?

This Variety cover story is more evidence that Hollywood continues to ignore abuse and racism when it serves their bottom line.

I needed to provide more ID for my American mail in ballot than any of the last 3 UK elections. (we still don't have substantial voter fraud, btw)
===
@frank35494 @OneEyeWilly16 @MikeBiden1 @WarmandFuzzy7 @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor No, I'm not. I'm stating statistical facts.
===
@frank35494 @OneEyeWilly16 @MikeBiden1 @WarmandFuzzy7 @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor Please explain how this is racist. Black voters were much more likely to vote by mail during last November’s election - this isn't something I'm pulling from thin air, it's literally a fact.
===
@Beerus69420 @OneEyeWilly16 @MikeBiden1 @WarmandFuzzy7 @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor Please, show evidence that illegal immigrants voted in this election. This would be voter fraud, which has not been found in Georgia.

You still have to provide some ID to vote, you just shouldn't have to provide it again. The problem you are complaining about doesn't exist.
===
@ChristyChambe77 @IndieWire Then write to the officials in Georgia who can revert these unfair changes and entice film makers back then, it is their job to look after their constituents jobs, not Luke Skywalkers
===
@MG_TCI @MiracleJanet @BT_Mattison @IndieWire So I can give water to people in line if I don't talk to them at all or is what you have just typed actually just BS made up to defend a clear attempt at voter suppression?
===
@thatmouthywoman @WarmandFuzzy7 @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor They're not as fond of the movie industry as you think. A lot of redder GA wants them gone because they think it's making the state more liberal. So, this is hurting the people more than the ones you're trying to punish.
===
@facts_suck @ChristyChambe77 @IndieWire @RepMTG Ga's vote has been suppressed for years, so no, not everyone voted them in. Also, mtg moved to literally the reddest in the state for this election and her and her q's sent so many death threats to her opponent that he had to drop out and leave the state. Does that sound voted in

@DawnBritton13 @robg5252 @IndieWire To ensure the photocopy is real I guess. What’s wrong with that?

Mark Hamill, James Mangold Refuse to Film in Georgia Over Republican-Backed Voting Law https://t.co/bkVfsrhIBj
===
@IndieWire This voting law could disrupt Georgia huge grip on TV shows and Movies filming there. Tons of stuff of films are shot there.
===
@TimPrime1 @CheezusPersonal @MSteitz468 @IndieWire Tim, stop watching Fox idiot

This law helps Republicans cheat and allows the state legislature to overtake the county election boards when the results don’t help them (ie. 2020 loss). So now they can throw out results from Black areas.
===
@WarmandFuzzy7 @CharlesWK_USMC @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor But black communities are already losing out because the voter suppression overwhelmingly impact those communities.

===
@WarmandFuzzy7 @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor Not true.  They VOTED them in.  They pay the price.
===
@ChristyChambe77 @IndieWire Rigging the rules (the legislature can remove local election boards AT WILL) is definitely anti-democracy.  Read the laws yourself and the language is clear.  If the legislature doesn't like how an election goes, they can change it to their liking.  That's just ONE law.

===
@WarmandFuzzy7 @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor Yes, they do when voting for their representatives.
===
@thisfuckin__guy @IndieWire Well, your handle is apt, even if your argument is flawed. The bullshit in GA is happening because the Republicans have latched onto the narrative that the left stole the election through voter fraud, even though there is zero evidence of that, and I don't condone that.
===
@LaBoomer68 @IndieWire I do not. Never owned any of those. Don't agree with the philosophies behind any of them. Funny how the left is acting like the very thing they're accusing the right of being, though.
===
@thisfuckin__guy @IndieWire The elected officials in question are pandering to the radical elements of their party, sadly. As were the Democrats, right up until they got in power and dropped most of the far left like hot potatoes. They gave us some of our money back to pacify y'all, and nothing else.
===
@thisfuckin__guy @IndieWire You don't know me and have made zero attempts to research my views. You are just making weak assumptions based on the narrative of conservatives you've been fed. I'm only, ONLY for the rights and freedoms of the individual being preserved, so long as they don't hurt anyone else.
===
@thisfuckin__guy @IndieWire Uh, no it's not. Most of us want EVERYONE who is a citizen of the USA to have the same rights and freedoms. You're applying a small subsect's mindset to all conservatives. Most of us aren't radicals, we just want the government to do its job, which is to uphold the constitution.
===
@thisfuckin__guy @IndieWire Nope. Only in your mind, my dude.
===
@thisfuckin__guy @IndieWire But you obviously haven't read the rest of my comments, where I make it quite clear that I don't like or support either major party. And you know nothing about what I do or do not care about. You're making assumptions based on preconceived notions that fit your little narrative.

@TimPrime1 @MSteitz468 @IndieWire Dude, in Georgia, the guy in charge of the election was one of the candidates.  He refused to recuse himself.
===
@TimPrime1 @IndieWire Requiring an ID for absentee ballots was the least controversial part of the bill.  There are numerous measures designed to reduce turnout.  The whole intent is to make voting harder, and it's been driven entirely by dissatisfaction with the outcome of 2020.
===
@moondogmadness @TimPrime1 @IndieWire Yes, the GOP is really scraping the bottom of the barrel.  That's what happens when you make a lifelong con man and sexual predator the leader of your party.
===
@TimPrime1 @MSteitz468 @IndieWire Politicians should want to make voting easier, not harder.

Republicans can't do that because they are committed to a strategy of minoritarian rule.
===
@MSteitz468 @TimPrime1 @IndieWire Shortened deadlines to apply for absentee ballots; reduced number of and access to drop boxes; disqualification of provisional ballots. Also, it allows the state to take over county election boards. This law was a solution looking for a problem.
===
@MSteitz468 @TimPrime1 @IndieWire No, Georgia Dems are pissed because Georgia Republicans decided to change the rules--the rules those same Republicans enacted in 2005--because they were unhappy with the outcome of the 2020 election.

@ClearClarity2 @FistofNietzsche @WarmandFuzzy7 @redezrobbins @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor Yeah but he's not just doing that he's also telling them that they should do it this way his way.
===
@Fwitterna @Buffalogerl @WarmandFuzzy7 @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor What the hell you talkin about? They voted for their governor their governor is the one that signed the bill they are completely responsible &amp; this is the consequences of their actions maybe next time they'll vote differently in the meantime these jobs will go to other Americans
===
@WarmandFuzzy7 @redezrobbins @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor What are you talking about "it will solve nothing" They are literally losing Millions! Money is the only thing that will solve and change anything because ultimately that's what anyone really cares about especially conservatives I mean they certainly put profit over lives.

@thisismylifeUSA @FistofNietzsche @WarmandFuzzy7 @redezrobbins @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor No not if that Talent works for that studio🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

===
Could make for a better show?? https://t.co/pV2TKFtAgX
===
@IndieWire Who cares?
===
@BurntBrian352 @IndieWire Yeah sugar tits...well anyone that would still support this outwardly corrupt GOP party should be forced to watch movies that only “star” Stacey Dash, Scott Baio . Willie Robertson and Kevin Sorbo...directed by Diamond and Silk.
===
@ElDubb @toilingturtle @IndieWire You don’t get it either. People depend on movies and tv so they can have jobs so they can eat and have a roof over their families’ heads. Be able to afford medicine &amp; healthcare etc.Boycotting puts people out of jobs. It’s not about watching movies.
===
@toilingturtle @IndieWire I don’t follow what you’re trying to say here?? It seems like you’re saying instead of boycotting but then what are you saying works instead? I’m saying boycotting hurts people who need jobs &amp; helps no one. It doesn’t seem to hurt politicians.
===
@toilingturtle @IndieWire Not everyone has the luxury of getting to choose the best job or the job they want- many have to take what they can get especially when they have families to take care of. This hurts &amp; punishes the wrong people who are innocent.
===
@IndieWire This is the kind of thing that also happened in North Carolina- that’s honorable you’re taking a stand against injustice but you are just hurting the people who rely on the movie &amp; tv industry to make a living. The politicians still get paid the same amount.
===
@tedwilliamsgoat @IndieWire So they should wait four more years to vote out the corrupt politicians? They need jobs NOW! GET IT?!?!
===
And yet here’s another reason that we love Mark Hamill! 💙@HamillHimself https://t.co/yWJfQxRkin

Fuck yeah @HamillHimself https://t.co/KjLImMsBpG
===
@IndieWire No ones watching that shit anyways
===
@object_shiny @IndieWire @elebenty This is the party of God! Damn. How far we have fell! If you can’t win the right way just change the fucking law because some fraudulent conman lost after backing your senate picks and you help with the lie from hell that something bad happened but no court agreed with that LIE!
===
@pinkpancreas @toilingturtle @IndieWire You don’t get it and you never will! Tell me how many people died while trying to get movies produced in their states? Ok. Now tell me how many people died trying to have the right to vote? You still want to have a debate about movies? Movies is movies. Voting is consequences!
===
@traveljunkie56 @TheresaDundas14 @IndieWire @MalcolmNance Your innocence not having a job doesn’t trump (no not the idiot) my right to vote! Georgia turned blue and the GOP got redder (in the face) and like the snakes they are changed voting laws because they could. We’ll concentrate on killing the filibuster and getting JL law passed!
===
@traveljunkie56 @TheresaDundas14 @IndieWire @MalcolmNance Talking to MAGATTS is a lost cause. They’re pissed from their Hitler losing so they approve of these racist ass laws but moral people object by refusing them their services. It’s the American way. If they keep storming state Capitals and shooting people up. They won’t win shit!
===
@WarmandFuzzy7 @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor F’ em. Boycott Coke and all other big company’s that didn’t speak out against this racist bullshit! Millions of people getting screwed out of representing their state is a much bigger fucking problem then a few hundred temporary goddamn jobs! They could’ve reached out for votes!
===
@ChristyChambe77 @IndieWire You guys privilege is showing. Again. Voting has consequences for some. Those some are always black majority of the time. So we have to vote as if our lives are at stake which they are at the present time. So movies ain’t high on our priority list when it comes to Jim Crow.
===
@IndieWire No thanks
===
@TheresaDundas14 @traveljunkie56 @IndieWire @MalcolmNance 2 people boycotting isn't that big of a deal 

the job loss you're talking about would take years and boycotts from hundreds of people in the movie business

@JutzRWB @shareitarie10 @DebSunshn @IndieWire I wish. I'd be rich by now.

@IndieWire Denying work to Georgians whose rights to vote are being denied. That makes sense, except it doesn't make sense. How about working with workers in Georgia to get them to polls or apply for Mail-In drop box ballots, or get IDs if they need them. Just don't deprive them from jobs

@pinkpancreas @IndieWire R u serious, the GQP and tRump were killing us anyway they could, with Covid, etc. We should worry about a little more pain I stead of protesting and boycotting, I m sorry it works.

@pinkpancreas @IndieWire Hello, money, their corporate sponsors need to be made to understand that voter suppression is unacceptable and yes we all suffer to make this point. Shame them don t work for them if u don t have to

@WarmandFuzzy7 @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor Excuse me, that state government is establishing  voter JIM CROW 2.0,  that makes them culpable in the loss of business. GA voters need to let this be known,. White supremacist need to be defunded.

@WarmandFuzzy7 @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor Ever work as an extra? Ever work temp work cleaning up sets?

@IndieWire Economic boycotts can be short or long. Unfortunately, lots of people can be hurt by the acts of their legislatures, but they can do something and tell those in charge to stop the racist BS

For a point of reference, review the 2010 economic boycott of the state of Arizona.

@ChristyChambe77 @IndieWire Worked in Arizona ...

===
@meraxes63 @neverstop556 @One1337Samurai @IndieWire When it takes 6+ hours to vote in some precincts, guess what, not getting basic necessities makes it difficult to vote, ya disingenuous fuck. Wait until you gear which voters have to wait in long lines. 
https://t.co/PAk5pduBYF
===
@rflagg13 @neverstop556 @IndieWire Bud, theyre gaslighting you. The way the law is written it says ANY person, not limiting it to political groups. The only allowance they put in is an unattended table set up by poll workers, they explicitly added that because it was a blanket ban.
===
@neverstop556 @meraxes63 @One1337Samurai @IndieWire Since youre being disingenuous, why are you continuing to lie about the law?
===
@meraxes63 @neverstop556 @One1337Samurai @IndieWire Apparently you don't know grammar. Each time there's a comma followed by the word, "nor" its a seperate statement. Otherwise, they wouldn't have added that only poll workers were able to:
"self-service water from an unattended receptacle to an elector waiting in line to vote."
===
@neverstop556 @rflagg13 @IndieWire Again with the distingenuous red herrings. Can you conservatives ever discuss anything in good faith without trying to use every logical fallacy in the book to distract away from the discussion?
===
@neverstop556 @paradigmster @rflagg13 @IndieWire There is nothing in the law about political interest groups. Why are you making stuff up?
===
@meraxes63 @neverstop556 @paradigmster @rflagg13 @IndieWire I can't believe I need to give an English lesson. You see commas denote lists, when a section starts "No person shall..." and the lists something, has a comma, then says "nor" those are seperate things that apply to the original subject, "No persons".
===
@neverstop556 @meraxes63 @One1337Samurai @IndieWire Lol, you have a funny read of the term "no person". Also, there's an exception built in later for Poll workers to put up an unmanned water table, why would they write that in if what you said was true? Why do you contiinue to lie?
===
@meraxes63 @neverstop556 @paradigmster @rflagg13 @IndieWire Yeah, they are. That's how sentences and series work. You're bad at this.

@neverstop556 @rflagg13 @IndieWire Lol, no person. A non-partisan volunteer group would be committing a crime if they just made sure people had basic needs met in hours long lines in, shocker, majority black precincts. This is a step back towards Jim Crow. Also, who gives a fuck about Ivy league graduations?
===
@meraxes63 @neverstop556 @One1337Samurai @IndieWire And your mom should have let that bar full of bikers just put you into her mouth. GFY Jim Crow apologist, there's no reason for this law other than cruelty and to discourage voters. That's it. It does not solve any problem other than the turnout from the 2020 elections.
===
@neverstop556 @rflagg13 @IndieWire And it's contadicted everything you have said.
===
@meraxes63 @neverstop556 @paradigmster @rflagg13 @IndieWire The "soliciting votes" and "give food or drink" are completely different sections. Hence "no persons" applies to both. Again, you're bad at grammar.
===
@neverstop556 @rflagg13 @IndieWire The GOP are openly admitting it in court, why keep up the charade?

Mysteries have always been Rian Johnson's sweet spot. Brick was a high school noir mystery. Brothers Bloom was an endearing mystery about cons. Looper was a sci-fi time travel mystery. Knives Out was a lot of fun. Even his Star Wars had some twists.

@Stephendinnet @Antibloviator @zjhuggins @4mmjf @IndieWire It would take a lot more than that to derail the Masters. The org, the players, and the fans are all pretty entrenched.

@shreknotbigfoot @neverstop556 @One1337Samurai @IndieWire And if you can’t, have a voter id and do a mail in ballot... it’s really not that hard to figure out. Your dad should’ve let you run down his leg. The world would’ve been better off
===
@shreknotbigfoot @neverstop556 @One1337Samurai @IndieWire SB 202 protects polling locations from electioneering by private individuals. Within 150 feet of the precinct election officials may provide water at stations. Beyond 150 feet as previous Georgia law allowed, private individuals may campaign and provide food and water for voters.
===
@shreknotbigfoot @neverstop556 @One1337Samurai @IndieWire He isn’t tho. So answer his question.
===
@shreknotbigfoot @rflagg13 @neverstop556 @IndieWire No it doesn’t say any person
===
@shreknotbigfoot @neverstop556 @One1337Samurai @IndieWire How the fuck is not giving water or food suppress the vote? Also you should require a photo id for mail in ballots....
===
@shreknotbigfoot @neverstop556 @paradigmster @rflagg13 @IndieWire No they aren’t.
===
@shreknotbigfoot @neverstop556 @paradigmster @rflagg13 @IndieWire You’re from Oregon so we don’t expect you to be smart and actually know that it’s only banned for political interest groups..
===
@shreknotbigfoot @neverstop556 @One1337Samurai @IndieWire You can make it without water or food 150 feet away from the polls. That doesn’t take 6hrs
===
@Headlong42 @SureFireSearle @IndieWire “What about” is a perfectly reasonable argument here. The boycott Georgia people are largely hypocritical. Also, if you cared about fair elections, you’d be against ballot harvesting. Just a thought.

@WarmandFuzzy7 @MatiasASeoane @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor Nope.  Just leave GA and other states hostile to human rights hanging. Disinvest from states who disenfranchise, or lose business. In 1978 we drove straight through from VA to GA as GA had ratified the era, and the betweens hadn't.  At this point, I see no reason to spend a penny
===
@WarmandFuzzy7 @redezrobbins @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor Concern trolling much?

@WarmandFuzzy7 @MatiasASeoane @IndieWire @SarcasmvsHumor I will not watch a show or buy a ticket for a movie filmed in a location that suppresses votes.  YMMV.

@JakeNBakeATL @IndieWire I’m curious what you think boycotts do? No boycott has ever not hurt those caught in the middle. Republicans only respond to $$, so that’s where any response must aim.

@IndieWire The more that boycott the better. As far as the jobs go and the impact on the local economy? Maybe Kemp should have thought of that before he decided that disenfranchising minority voters was more important than a stable campaign to film in Georgia.

@TheresaDundas14 @IndieWire @MalcolmNance Then they should speak to their shitty representative...

@HockeyNow65 @IndieWire Works for me. This is a representation issue and you want to label it a political issue. Republicans vote, too, and some of them may be people of color, poor, rural, lacking transportation, immobile, non-tekkies, dehydrated...

@IndieWire Keep it going. Last time Kemp tried a scam like this, Hollywood threatened to pull out all their filming and let the state lose $9 billion dollars.

See how quickly that law got changed
===
@IndieWire @WalkingDead_AMC, time to take a stand.
===
@pattymchugh1212 @IndieWire The entertainment industry investment in the state is a major reason why Georgia voted Dem in Nov &amp; Jan. Pulling out is giving up, leaves Warnock for defeat in 2022. Seems defeatist

Not voting also has consequences

@IndieWire Time to put major pressure on @WalkingDead_AMC @AMC_TV . They have a major set in Senoia. By them continuing to film there, they condone these racist voter suppression laws. @JDMorgan @kharypayton @angelakang @hardwick

@IndieWire This is not heroic. It is actually what the GOP wants. They blame "Hollywood types" for turning GA blue. This will only hurt the small businesses, many of whom are minority owned in GA, that support the filming industry.
===
@HeatThrice @wwl173 @lefty_lucie @IndieWire @StevenErick1976 Agree with you 100 percent! All I am saying is people can make their case without trying to literally destroy their opposition. I love political debate it but seems like all we do is yell at each other now. Not very productive.

@IndieWire problem with boycotting Georgia if it effects the good people who voted for two Democrats as Senators
===
@KidCreole3 @IndieWire @UrsulaV Anyway I can appreciate that you're mad about POC getting screwed over. Its worth being mad about! But arguing with me and Ursulav isn't going to get Mark Hamill to work in Georgia, nor is it going to get the screwed up laws fixed. Maybe redirect your energy?
