CO2 is now 415ppm
Temperatures may have increased 1C in 150 years, but records are now so corrupt it's impossible to say and sea level rise of 1.7mm is the same a it has been for 1000s of years despite fudging satellite data.
That's it. Anything more is a guess.

I have over 500 skydives in my logbook. If someone else packed my rig and they told me they were uncertain of what they did, do you think I would jump?  
Uncertain = Not a clue.

Basic math tells you averaging averages, as long as the count of numbers in each sub average is the same, is no different than just averaging all the numbers. https://t.co/GYnNpcqSKZ

The moment you average sub averages where the counts of numbers are not the same you run into Simpson's Paradox. In this case this is a natural result from the Central Limit Theorem. 

Averaging averages is almost never correct unless great care is taken. https://t.co/iPXJfHNdAx

@TalkingSuperman I feel like a key factor in superhero comics is the costumes and secret identities or at least aliases. Hellboy is like a cryptid: Jersey Devil, Chupacabra, yeti, etc. in that his existence at all is uncertain. He fights monsters not supervillains.

I stated it because some people here think that the most recent warming is produced by scientists adjusting data. 

 Showing that it is our warming is a different thing.

Unfortunately for her she didn't read the original nor the rebuttal.  🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️

It was funny they used a silly argument like

Their data shows a cooling trend, or at the very least a non-warming trend, up until the late 70s.

The IPCC in AR5 said "in the last 50 years" which the was back to 1961.

Why is there a lack of consistency between agencies?

Statistically, the travel distance for IR photons in the atmosphere is lower than required to escape into space.

More CO2 in the atmosphere just alters the relation between the main red arrows.

So, did you find the time to run the simulations with the publicly available data and code yourself already? If what you claim is true, you could easily refute his results if some secret ingredient is missing.

It is a little more complex than that, as the long wave radiation emitted from the atmosphere towards earth also results from directly absorbed short wave radiation from the sun and convected heat.

With more CO2, the 104 and 98 values will rise.

They just used the word because it was popular. They assassinated any among them that held any socialist beliefs in the "night of the long knives". 

They were Fascist and didn't care very much about the economic system

Anti-semitism is everywhere.

They were unambiguously Fascist, authoritarian right-wing, they didn't so much have an economic system as a stealing system.

You have no idea what socialism is.

Until late 1970s, essentially no warming. Since 1980, warming of 0.6 to 0.8.  Anthropogenic portion unknown. Historical revisions and counting early 20th century warming and 100% to GHGs is disingenuous https://t.co/vFTrOeaJ7F

What percentage of IR radiation is currently reflected back at the earth and what percentage will be at 600ppm.

The short wave radiation was unaffected by rising CO2 so that should not make a difference should it?

The term is anyway absurd, and CO2 is not as such "carbon", but a compound of it. So stop breathing, all animals! https://t.co/M8Q2JxpS2H
