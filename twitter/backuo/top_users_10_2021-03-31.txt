@darryn @FoxNews I'm GREATEST IDIOT at this planet.

How come ??

BECAUSE...

1- I've never had Smoking, Alcohol, Drug, Premarital sex &amp; Extramarital Affairs.
2- I'm not interested in name, fame, food, clothes, money &amp; properties.

EVEN my family, friends &amp; relatives don't know about my tweets.

@TIME @andrewrchow @LilNasX Best way to avoid LGBTQ repression is AVOID PDA.

PDA is not needed at all.....your LOVE &amp; LUST can be shown for each other in bed-room.

Because two real brothers and real sisters don't get discriminated in public....if you avoid PDA...How come anyone can find your identity ??

"Satan portrayed by: Satan" so I think he was playing himself

@dougvansant @chanceinaustin @lonjets @sedonaprince_ @FatKidDeals @NCAA And, for clarity’s sake...let’s see the statistics of men vs women weight room usage (hours) of the teams in the men’s tournament vs the teams in the women’s tournament. I don’t complain about the disparity in dressing rooms in Big 5...men have less, I deal with it.
===
@lonjets @dougvansant @chanceinaustin @sedonaprince_ @FatKidDeals @NCAA 👍🏻 You must feel so cool. Thanks for sharing your completely irrelevant, troglodyte opinion. I’m guessing you’re the guy sitting in the corner of said gym FILLED with women being a perv. Much appreciated.
