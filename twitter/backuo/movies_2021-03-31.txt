@___honghua Hdhshshahsh too thirsty to imagine them in a movie genre i love the most
===
I just realized that spoofs went away. Movies like Airplane and Space Balls, Naked Gun and even Scary Movie. I never was a fan of that genre but I know they were beloved classics. I guess the ultimate spoof was Austin Powers, which I only tolerated because I love Mike Myers.
===
Not a huge animation fan, especially in this genre. But that‚Äôs a personal preference thing. Overall I see why folks love it as a movie. Just not my bag. https://t.co/zvJ0Rrm1m3

@IcANgetyou_ @incorrectgsp Ohh. I deleted my prev tweet kasi I am an amateur haha; not too familiar with the genre. I just thought it's unusual in romcoms to hold the neck or press the cheek like that. So Ian as actor must want to convey some deeper meaning w that kiss.

#Aoharuride the live adaptation movie's thread;

This anime is my first love in romance genre and seeing this in a live movie adaptation delighted me so much. Probably, it's not the best and it's not perfect as well, BUT this one's worth it. I luv that it has some added scenesüíê https://t.co/nbYCMQJJFG

And no one can change my mind until now, even tomorrow or the day after that. Ao haru ride, either movie or anime or even manga version, this one is the best and the top-tier romance genre story in my heart. It's undeniably the best one for meüçÇ

i cant explain it but spy kids and shark boy and lava girl are a genre of movie that sit at the same table
===
@jaytholen Oh sure, and I haven't seen the movie so I can't say how well it hit the mark. But the over importance placed on genre films (as a guy who adores genre) can lead to people needlessly shredding the movies that somehow don't measure up to that importance.

It's not outrageous to expect a kaiju movie (esp. involving Godzilla) to have thematic weight. Shin Gojira (2016) won several Japanese Academy Awards.

@PieeSidity What are you in the mood for? Genre, show, movie, etc.

even tho they were all shit, I kinda miss the parody movie genre

action? thriller? mystery? romance? comedy? drama?

@ujungceI if I get a good response, i going to do a twitter poll have y‚Äôall decide what genre &amp; ill pick a movie from that

@C9Ness I‚Äôm so glad to see that movie finally getting the recognition it deserves. Sucks it came out when the horror genre was saturated with found footage style films.
===
i love the horror genre so much but since horror games have hardened me, its hard to find a good horror movie
===
The horror genre is dead, every other movie is trying to be like The Conjuring
===
So I've officially given up on art house cinema (at least for a couple of days). My genre of choice is now Kaiju. If you need me I'll be watching the original Godzilla movies. #Godzilla #BringOntheMonsters #Kaiju

@Ltward2 Such a great movie. Sci-fi/ horror perfection. It truly set the bar for the genre.
===
I agree that the tweet is pedantic. But I don't like people jumping on it saying "It's a Godzilla/Monster movie, what do you expect?". There's a lot of thoughtful and meaningful godzilla movies with rly great characters and storylines, the same thing goes for the genre as a whole https://t.co/wfMokqMnzY

===
Americans who look at kaiju films and and go ‚ÄúITS NOT MEANT TO BE GOOD! IS JUST MONSTER FIGHTING‚Äù are racist tbh 

the genre is still made and defined by a movie that was a metaphor for a national tragedy in which America dropped a nuke on Japan.
===
saying ‚ÄúTHIS MOVIE CAN BE BAD AND JUST CG FIGHTS IS BECAUSE THE WHOLE GENRE IS JUST THAT TOKUSATSU DOESNT HAVE TO BE ABOUT ANYTHING‚Äù are illiterate and racist.

Rolling my eyes hard at this review. You don't necessarily have to be a fan of a genre in order to review a film within that genre, but at least try to look at it from the perspective of fulfilling the hallmarks of that genre.

TL;DR - Watch a Godzilla movie. https://t.co/Sw9oC83uEO

I really like this podcast - you get all of this great context and flavor, besides the movie stuff, and it‚Äôs not strictly one genre. It‚Äôs smart and funny - the episode with A New Leaf &amp; Love Story was great, so‚Äôs the Alligator/Fade to Black one. You should listen. https://t.co/l5dgPPeK0n

@GailSimone @Shudder Anywhere! It‚Äôs a ‚Äúmovie of the week‚Äù format, hosted by @therealjoebob and @kinky_horror. They have commentary, trivia, and interviews where commercial breaks would be, and they pull movies from all over the horror genre, from incredible to bonkers. Love it.

@theyearofelan I don‚Äôt care for this genre or even play video games. Saw the trailer this past weekend when I saw Nobody. The movie looks fantastic.

@bryanedwardhill Love the idea of going deeper and deeper underground to the point of no return, to me that‚Äôs a terrifying concept and I feel that they do it really well in this movie. In answer to the first question, I feel that the genre has indeed become stale in recent years, however...

To put that in comic book movie terms, I feel like it would need to be not just four great comic book movies, but four that represent the genre for different eras or different ways. And that's tricky to pinpoint down to 4 movies.

See, it's tough because the superhero movie genre has already gone through so many highs and lows since as far back as the 60s and 70s. If not earlier if you include serialized TV like the George Reeves stuff. It's CONSTANTLY redefined as recently as Into the Spider-Verse.
===
I think maybe Blade or X-Men belongs there as the movie that revitalized the genre. I always use a door-to-door salesman analogy to describe what happened to superheroes then.

Blade knocked on the door.
X-Men stuck its foot in.
Spider-Man kicked the door right off its hinges.

@AllisonRFloyd @meghanttucker Carrie wasn't scary, but it was important to the genre. You're right about Kubrick, and it does put a dark cloud over the film.

üëë: Perhaps, and hear me out, there's an issue with media reviews in which a subject is examined in comparison to the broad entries within the medium as opposed to the genre, intent and marketing of a movie.
===
üëë: I'm just saying, ultimately, if your criticism of a movie is that it lived exactly up to the way it was marketed and likely falls in line with genre conventions and therefore it bad - maybe have a rethink about how you should approach a review.
===
üëë: Sure, a movie labelled monster x vs monster y, inspired by a genre of cartoony hijinks and big beast battles might not have the realistic and thought provoking commentary when compared to such a move like The Noun, and can be criticised as such.

@GameSpot This sounds like exactly what monster movie fans have been asking for. People don't go to see monster movies for the humans. They go to see monsters destroy shit. If you can't understand something as simple as that, get your head out of your ass and stay out of the genre.

March 30th: NERUDA (Amazon Prime). A film in my least fave genre, the biopic, but as always with Chilean director Pablo Larrain, this goes in a v unexpected direction. It's the director's most oblique film, but one of his most rewarding, especially if you know its subject's work. https://t.co/uIvDdUD3KP

Hiii!! Theo went here at my unit and invited me to watch a movie. Oli suggested '365 days'(?) What genre is this?

I'm so tired of people undermining the kaiju genre. It's okay not like it because it is a niche genre. However downplaying it as "dumb monster movie" does such a disservice to what these movies about; mythology, world building, and having human characters explore these things.

Genre is rarely given respect &amp; attention it deserves.

its kind of hard to describe angels of death since its more about the journey and dialogue and a synopsis wouldnt do it justice

Stories, movie and TV series add another dimension to our reality. They are set as relievers for our psychological needs or social needs. The type or genre of fiction stories one might endulge can precisely express one's psychological state.
===
@j2tiger Honestly I dunno. But a superhero movie that doesnt care about the alter ego isnt anywhere near the top. And thats just the tip of the iceberg.

Personal favorite is Hellboy but its a genre that is hard to pin down the "greatest"

@xolotltolox @TheStrxggler No, my argument js that if you go into a movie that's genre is know for being stupid monsters fighting I wouldn't expect the plot or story to be all that coherent
===
Dark Knight. Guardians of the Galaxy. Spider-Man 2. Infinity War.

I‚Äôll point out I think Captain America: The Winter Soldier could also have made this list but I arranged by both quality and how revolutionary for the genre each movie was. https://t.co/kzofl3IbJO

@lifeisabanqvet Could not watch a zombie movie again if you paid me. Living through the 2010s obsession and a global pandemic is a sure fire way to kill a genre
===
@softiebp what's the genre of that movie
===
@jtrujillo109 @SarahTrance @BluRayAngel - Bruce Wayne
- Martha &amp; Thomas Wayne
- Alfred Pennyworth
- The Joker

Ratcatcher was teased and the movie was set in Gotham. Just because it was a different genre to usual doesn't make it any less of a movie based off a comic book
===
It would be a mistake to dismiss 'The Meteor Man' simply because it doesn‚Äôt fit neatly into the superhero genre. ‚òÑÔ∏è https://t.co/KSpYLiEdxh

thor ragnarok is one of the best mcu movies bc rather than trying to prove anything about how the mcu is ‚Äòcinema‚Äô or whatever, they just full on embraced the campiness and absurdity of the genre and took it further!
===
@spurs_four Tdk is God tier.
It's the movie that changed the genre.
But zsjl is really good.
It's got heart soul and characters that are very defined.
It was a debut for cyborg and Aquaman and it handled it all pretty well.
But comparing it to TDK
Is clown behaviour.
===
@lawblizzard I think that's the only genre of movie that I haven't watched on the big screen
===
i wanna watch a Scott Pilgrim ass movie. not Scott Pilgrim exactly but the genre
===
Anyway, I'm looking forward for this kind of genre for HIY and MKY to play in the future. If not possible, he can be paired with any actress! üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü•∞

We would love to see matured role as well hi_high_hiy üíú

@RemyDushine @GameSpot Why not?
I can review a movie as a movie in general or a genre movie.
I can tell you they will be rated differently.
This is what I'd call a guilty pleasure, and for a guilty pleasure it's a 10/10.
As a movie compared to Citizen Kane or Ran, even a 5 is a bit optimistic.
===
@RemyDushine It's a genre movie. That sets a framework
It can still be epic, mediocre or terrible.
But what I took from this review is that the reviewer expected something else.
IMO this movie did everything (or most) a genre movie should do right.
===
But we will fight for this poster and I, particularly, will fight for this genre. I will make more comedy movie posters and will do my bit to change this awful and stupid trend. https://t.co/4YRVvTCVbx
===
@smellikelove genre friendship, romance, and a little slice of life. in general, the movie talks about a friendship between 3 high school students who have their own struggles and mainly talk about how they developed their friendship
===
If Kim Taehyung acts as a villain in any movie or drama,he will create a new genre which will give a big blow to the industry
We want actor Kim Taehyung..
===
what's your go-to movie genre? do you hv like a movie you've watched multiple times but still wouldn't get bored ‚Ä¶ ‚Äî hmmm i prefer animations! like disney or pixar, especially if its musical! oh and i really like the greatest show‚Ä¶ https://t.co/NlRclMan9r
===
@doseofsnark What is truly astonishing is how each performance comes from a completely different genre to the others. Clooney is costumed from a 90s rom com, Thurman thinks she's in a 50s B movie, Arnie is a one-line pun machine stuck in the 80s and Schumacher is directing a gay fetish flick.
===
What Movie Genre Do u like watching?
===
@jemelehill @AnthonyMackie @JHillUnbothered @disneyplus We‚Äôre not making more Denzels, Violas, Eddie Murphys, Forest Whitakers, Angela Bassets, Sam Jacksons, Morgan Freemans...

We are the face of Black Cinema and American cinema worldwide and this trend of replacing us will be the death of the Black American film genre.

although cbms are much different now, superman: the movie was the gold standard for the genre. its pure adaptation of the character is something you cant find in modern superhero movies. campy and corny, yes, but this is the OG baby. https://t.co/alUMbRfgSU

#TakeBack 'Awesome fight scenes..fun movie showcases @GillianIliana a leading lady who carries a movie with absolute ease, hope she continues at forefront of kickass females in the genre,look forward to seeing what she does next' @ActionReloaded @101_Films https://t.co/68HtWfEF0a

Apparently there was a director who was super into incest and he made a LOT of incest porn videos so much so that he saturated the porn industry with it till it became a genre https://t.co/SiHsnCIVzL

actor kim taehyung ..wow i am so excited..i dont mind the genre or character or scenes he will do becoz at the end its his choice, he is the one acting ...i should respect it...

@kdramatreats @pinkeonjin Genre queen. Best actress thingz #SonYeJin

Superman - This movie made possible the idea that the superhero genre can not only be successful, but it can open serious opportunities for great cinema. Like Star Wars, Superman was a movie that got several current actors and directors interested in movies to begin with https://t.co/r3Kd2PLE1u

The best genre of movie is 80's action, this fact is inarguable. https://t.co/k8dvMn2YBr
