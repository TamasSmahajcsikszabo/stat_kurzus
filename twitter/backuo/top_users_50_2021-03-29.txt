@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Oh yeah, like, being arospec I basically just assume that there IS a thing other people are experiencing and describing and like, good for them!!!

Honestly I like the word queerplatonic bc it could be a way of describing those friends-who-are-family relationships.
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I'm confused about the expectation that one should have only one "not actually related but definitely Family" person? Like...either I'm WILDLY romantically polyamorous, which seems unlikely, or I just don't experience a difference between platonic and romantic. So. Yeah!
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I'm with cloudteeth - I don't really Get a difference between romantic &amp; familial feelings if you remove sex for a moment, but I like to just let that be there for the people who do. Like, I'm arospec, so.

What I absolutely do experience is a difference between Family + Friends.
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite But if someone sticks around long enough a bit of my brain goes, okay, you are Family now, and there's a pretty big distinction because then their presence is relevant to like my Life Decisions.

I realise this is probably what ace dating looks like, but in that case,
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Like there's people who are your bros, kindof - you might be close or not, but primarily they're a chill hang, and you're not super involved in each other's lives. Then there's a sortof intermediate thing of being close friends, but that can be temporary, like romo relationships.
===
@wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite This confusion is basically how I determined I'm arospec. Not that it really matters, since I'm not ace and am open to relationships; I just don't seem to feel like non-sexual intimacy and commitment has two separate ways of being. Romantic friends assure me they do.
===
i was just Exhausted but she’s taking her job as an ESA very seriously which is definitely a good thing
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite aha yeah, i totally get that! unfortunately i’m not especially great at identifying or expressing my own emotions, which makes explaining it kind of difficult lol
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite in my XP it’s in a similar vein to romantic r-ships (w/the things mentioned above involved) but lacks the romantic feelings. the name came abt bc it was coined (iirc) by aro ppl looking for ways to label their committed, unromantic r-ships. 1/3
===
still thinking abt the time someone told me i have the same energy as this vine https://t.co/LxMqhpmmmD
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite like u can want to snuggle with family &amp; not want to wife em up, yknow? it’s just a different way of including an important person in ur life
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that’s fine! i’m just trying to explain why QPR isn’t just a “silly queer” way of referring to friendships, and i’ve done my best to explain my understanding of the emotional differences, but i really can’t offer anything else on the matter.
===
thinking abt bottomji getting fucked by wwx &amp; having serious Feelings abt how wwx lays himself across lwj’s back, mindless of his scars—or perhaps bc of them, covering him now bc he couldn’t then
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite i think it’s the active decision to commit to a r-ship with the understanding that there will be different social expectations than with a friendship that marks the difference honestly.
===
@zeesongxiao np!! i think a lot of ppl get confused by QPRs bc it’s very much a nonstandard way to commit urself to another person, so i try to offer my small bit of insight when i can ☺️
===
pigeon’s legit babying me bc she was worried that i didn’t get out of bed today lol
===
@womb2tombs losing my shit ur 100% correct
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that’s pretty much what goes down w/QPRs as well, but the driving feelings &amp; methodology for intensifying the r-ship will likely be different. it’s hard to verbalize the differences bc these r very closely related emotions
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that’s fine! i’m just trying to explain why QPR isn’t just a “silly queer” way of referring to friendships, and i’ve done my best to explain my understanding of the emotional differences, but i really can’t offer anything else on the matter.
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite mmm that’s definitely harder to nail down, bc Emotions, but think abt how ur feelings toward ur family (assuming a pos. r-ship) differ from those for a romantic partner; they’re no less intense, can still be described as love, &amp; involve a lot of committment
===
whenever i think abt jiang chemg i wind up thinking abt that bpd book “i hate you don’t leave me” which i think says a lot
===
i did wind up sleeping all day today which i feel awful abt but i think i really needed it
===
@womb2tombs NO 😱 just thinking abt that Hurts me holy shit
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite it’s like, ig the way i’d say it is ur not Craving ur QPR in the same way as u crave a romantic partner (no desire for like. kissing &amp; such, even if u do want physical intimacy ie cuddling/hugs). it’s still intense, but in a different direction, if that makes sense?
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite lol tbh i feel like a lot of ppl never really feel the need to distinguish btwn these sorts of emotions (since most ppl focus on intensifying their romantic rships rather than their platonic ones)
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite QPR reinforces the idea that ace &amp; aro ppl r inherently queer, and as such all of their r-ships r also queer, even when they’re platonic rather than romantic. &amp; while u can certainly think of QPRs as being “intense friendships” i feel like doing that overlooks the nature of QPRs
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite (namely that they’re more involved/committed than “friendship” suggests). think abt friends getting married for those sick benefits &amp; being totally chill abt it w/no desire or expectation for romantic growth &amp; ur on the right track for what QPRs are 3/3

@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite this convo is certainly making me feel like i've maybe been missing something big and didn't even know it
story of my life lol
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite ok interesting! i think i have just discovered my main problem which is that i apparently do not really understand what makes a relationship romantic. (i thought it was the wish for commitment and for playing a somewhat more exclusive role in someone's life)
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite i feel like the issue for defining what makes a relationship "romantic" is seriously hindered by the sexual dimension that is conventionally expected to be a part of it.
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that dimension removed, i'm having a very hard time pinpointing the difference to a "merely" platonic relationship if it's *not* intensity or commitment (which it presumably isn't if there is a separate category for platonic + intense + committed)
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite well, i'd say, for a while the difference is in a conscious wish to intensify the depth of the relationship, and gain that level of commitment; then, once achieved, its actually very much akin to familial love.
(there's also the element of sex, but i'm keeping that out of it.)
