@BoardGameHalv @BlueOrangeGames This game has intruiged me for a while, I really love the standees and the mechanics look really interesting! Will really enjoy watching this HTP later! 🌳💕
===
@gamesandbourbon This combination is just... incredible! 🍷🎲
===
@lidmanjgames @TheGameBoyGeek Persistence is the key to victory!
===
@TheGamingGang @AmuzaGames I've seen a few food-related games popping up recently; it's great to have these new colourful entries into the genre. This one looks like it'll be especially nice on the table (and tasty!). 🍕
===
@PressStartLead1 Every idea, no matter how small, always gets documented and put somewhere easily accessible - a great resource to plumb during times when inspiration isn't striking or you can't engage the right mindset when coming up with new ideas!
===
#boardgames are like little worlds 🌎 inside a box 📦. One of the joys of being a #tabletop creator ✏️ is choosing where to send your players, what challenges 🎲 ⚔️ to let them face, giving them an immersive, fun break from the real world 💻 (however long or short!) ♥️ #bgg
===
@LilUnivOfGaming @Koenigvonsiam The artwork and theme of this game is so beautifully eye-catching. I just want to step into those cards and feel the sunshine on my face 😊🌞🖼️
===
@terraternity Absolutely love the design of this board! Very unique and would look incredible on the table! Great use of colour too 🎨
===
@MR_LonelyTable Darkest Night can seem a bit heavy at first, but you can get in a real groove with it and get the play down pretty streamlined. You can also customise the game's difficulty with a unique set of starting conditions, which I REALLY love. A great @VPGame (we really look up to 'em!)
===
@MR_LonelyTable @FFGames Elder Sign keeps getting to the table, though I think I've played it so much now that I can 'see the matrix' 😅
===
@terraternity @dani_standring @BoardGameGran @Puffindor I accept fine, craft ales! 🍺
===
@gamesandbourbon @ChrisHandy There are so many reasons to want social nights back - not just because there are many games we all own that simply won't work without a group present, but because the tactile nature of sitting round a table, sharing jokes and strategies, just can't be replicated as well online.

It's hump day! Let's round up some of the wonderfully creative and passionate individuals we've been eyeing-up this week in the community! 🎲🎙️🎬

@GrappleManiacs
@AtikinGames 
@Faza_BoardGame 
@Dice_and_Dragon 
@Punchboarders 
@CardsOrDie 
@foulplaygamers

Much ♥️ from us!
===
@MR_LonelyTable @FFGames As a long-time player of all of the games in the FF Arkham series, I found the game-play style between the newest AH (3rd ed.) more streamlined than the 2nd ed. The game is hard, though, and like most HPL properties, losing is often part of the theme! It's not for everyone 😊
===
@maxpanysh @Bob_gamedev Could you tweak it to make the reverse plate in a different color, like you see in some countries? Awesome work regardless! Dynamic generation is always neat!
===
You can swing by the @OneStopCoopShop's YouTube channel in a few hours to catch the Cosmic Voyage #boardgame livestream! We're grateful to the team for covering this cooperative, spacefaring dice-chucker! https://t.co/gDI4X2psJE Thanks to all our followers for their support! ♥️
===
@mattthr @therewillbegame Oof, I would hate to pack up my board game cupboard! Frankly I'm frightened to open it sometimes! But this is an opportunity to build new and exciting organisational solutions! 🎲📦
===
@lidmanjgames @theportaldragon @Zmangames_ Had real trouble trying to find a copy of this! It was up there with Friday as a great solo option, but it keeps slipping by! I'll get a copy one day and be able to add it to my collection of great solos!
===
@GamesR1k @BitrichInfo What a beautiful logo! Wonderful work ♥️
===
@vpcincy Whenever I have the opportunity to visit the U.S. again, this place is most definitely on my list!
===
@mattthr Opportunity always waits around the corner, often out of sight. You never truly see it until you walk round and give it your full attention. You can always look back and remember the good times ❤️
===
... bonuses to all of the crew, such as access to bonus rolls for the duration. The type of hazard deck you build for your game can be customised to fit your playstyle. Prefer more bonuses? More attacking warships to raise the challenge? Maybe more items? The choice is yours! 2/2
===
@WhyThatPlay1 @BoardgameSpam @Pandasaurusgame @BrothersMurph Their channel is fantastic! ♥️
===
@chixcangame Hugs 🤗
===
@PaulLenkic @UpperDeckEnt It did... not end well for Dario! 😲
===
@GamesWaddle Do you think you'll have placeable water tiles to mix-up the board layout eventually? Or maybe dynamic water tiles that affect placement during the game? This looks SO awesome! 🌿🐨
===
@GamersGenie @BlueOrangeGames @ReinerKnizia This looks absolutely fantastic! Lovely map design as well! 🗺️
===
@4ChitsNGiggles There is definitely an element of FOMO with games at times. Wanting to make sure ‘that game’ is in your collection, eventually forming the cornerstone of the well-played phrase ‘I’ll get around to that at some point’! 😅
===
@bags4dice I was absolutely adamant that I get a neoprene mat added to our KS offering. Though it's easy enough to play most games without them, there's something uniquely beautiful about having such a nice big canvas for artwork and design to sit underneath the game components! 🎲
===
@terraternity @dani_standring @BoardGameGran @Puffindor Thanks for including us on this list. We're super excited about what you guys are putting together! 🌎🎲
===
@WatchItPlayed Spending 10 minutes carefully packing away a game only to realise you’ve packed it into the lid is... the... worst!
===
A new space has appeared on the board, but what could it mean? #boardgames #totallynotteasing https://t.co/pOQs7CBd9Y
===
When planning to add a nice spacecraft visual to the front of the boardgame's box, it's really hard not to be inspired by the ship designs and aesthetic of @NoMansSky. The design styling throughout is still a joy to peruse.
===
@LederGames @thebrockart All of them! #WafflesWithWaffles
===
@BGameStories The Initiative looks incredible! Absolutely love the aesthetic of this, and especially adore that it's cooperative. Team-sleuthing? Sign me up!
===
@ZatuGames @AdeptLibrarium @bushontheradio There are a LOT of games from ZATU in there 😂
===
@BGInquisition These are beautifully painted! 🖌️🎨
===
@Of_Dice_and_Men @TabletopGameTlk Watching videos of games being played is always a staple of purchasing decisions for me! And often then becomes a requirement for understand the rules before playing (which is great, as you find out odd edge-cases and rule proclivities the rulebook may have missed out!)
===
@StillsaneShane @PQubeAsia Physical ownership of products adds a tactility that, in itself, is leagues more enjoyable than solely digital (in my opinion!). Something about the backdrop of all of the glorious box &amp; cover art is soothing.
===
@ambient_soup Soon thereafter adopting 'alternative ability to turn on again' 😅
===
@MR_LonelyTable @FFGames Interested in your thoughts on Eldritch Horror, if you've played also? I have most of the EH expansions, but I know that playing anything other than the base game can make it sprawl a bit out of control. Fun, but I've had sessions lasting over 8 hours ending in a loss! 😅
===
@ebaraf Yikes, will have to bear this in mind in future! ❤️
===
@Nerfenstein 'Like what you like' is always a good mantra! I think it's very easy to start collecting though, knowing you will struggle to find the time to play everything! ♥️
===
@LankyGamerUK I would have loved to include a limited run of metal tracking tokens with the game, but who knows - there may be scope to look at this in future as a nice bonus! I love the idea of heavy, impactful accessories like this!
===
🎉THANK YOU for helping us reach 300 followers!🎉 We are so thrilled to be part of such a wonderful community. We think you're all pretty darn awesome, as a matter of fact. Right now, we're working on our 1-4 player cooperative #boardgame Cosmic Voyage! 🚀 Stay tuned for more! ♥️ https://t.co/bH4srsTzeC
===
@Punchboarders A late episode is better than no episode! ♥️
===
@MR_LonelyTable I know the feeling all too well! We have a small walk-in cupboard (the best we have right now) which is floor-to ceiling with #boardgames. 124 at my last count. Most played, but some juicy big ones yet to open when the world returns to normal! https://t.co/I7FQtt57Ol
===
@TheBoardDad @GapCloserGames Tha artwork in this game is fantastic! Looks like so much fun 🧑🏻‍🍳
===
@kovraystudios @ElfCreekGames Isn't the design of this game just incredible? The artwork is so colorful and vibrant. Something I aspire to, though it's often difficult to marry it with space-bound themes (it works for The Captain is Dead, however!). 🐝🌻
===
@WatchItPlayed I’ve often thought that a small half-circle cutout at the bottom of each side of the lid would make this problem go away!
===
🎬 New 10 minute mini-preview of Cosmic Voyage! Grab your spacesuits and head on over to https://t.co/lsicTyWuyd to watch it played! 🚀🎲 #
#boardgame #bgg #tabletop #boardgamegeek #boardgames
===
@thestonecircle Best of luck with your campaign, you'll smash it! Fantastic art style and theming here, will be great to see lots more!
===
@MR_LonelyTable @atlasgames Mine will perform the following, expected, feline actions:
- Any board game box lid is an immediate home for a fuzzy butt
- Meeples are not game components, but rather feline flick toys
- Paws will invariably step on, and flick, carefully-organised decks of cards across the table
===
@AlfredOkorocha @ZdenekDolezal So... will this become a delxue collectors' edition of Screwball Scramble? ♥️
===
@StillsaneShane @PQubeAsia I couldn't agree more! ♥️
===
@MR_LonelyTable @BoardGameGeek I see you have a penchant for sleuthing games! Do you have/have played Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective? I have some friends that love this type of game and wondered if it’d be worth picking up the first one to give it a go myself! 🔎🕵️‍♀️
===
@maxpanysh @Bob_gamedev That's awesome! Making everything customisable through code is a great way to make design changes super flexible down-the-line. Really nice work!
===
@AtikinGames Here's hoping for an eventual meeple-filled afternoon!
===
@ZatuGames @AdeptLibrarium @bushontheradio Cooperative games are such a passion. Out of the 120+ games in my collection, probably only 10 of those are competitive! ♥️
===
@StillsaneShane @PQubeAsia I think there are very few games in my collection that I couldn't get much more life out of. That in itself is a value for money proposition that is well worth the price of entry.
===
@terraternity Honestly can't wait, the theming and style of this looks right up my street!
===
@BeardedUniverse Much love ❤️🤗
===
@TabletopTinker @russ_charles @SteamforgedLtd That looks like a heap of fun!
===
@MR_LonelyTable @BoardGameGeek It's becoming an impossible choice! But on nights where I'm exhausted from work, it's almost always something quick-to-the-table (like a roll-and-write). But on more ambitious nights, I'm all for a grand adventure, or something more involved like Darkest Night!
===
@WiscoDice @czechgames I have to say the board in this game looks absolutely stunning. As a huge fan of space-themed games, this one looks particularly incredible on the table. The round central board is amazing!
===
@MR_LonelyTable @atlasgames Cats are the furry engines that power our days! Great game choices too! 😻
===
@wizardryfoundry It looks absolutely beautiful. Something that absolutely needs to be in my collection!
===
@bushontheradio I'm envisioning a horse-racing version of Rallyman GT and am irrationally excited. Instead of cutting people up on the apex you can whip them with your riding crop. 🐴🎲
===
@A_deck_of_51 Such an eye-catching design, a real looker for the table!
===
@foulplaygamers @Wiggles3DGames We recently picked this up and LOVE it. I'm a big fan of games that you can use to kick off an evening of fun, and this one definitely delivers, and has endless replay potential too!
===
@NerdProbReviews Fantastic review, this game sounds absolutely fascinating! Looks quite grandiose when set up, but that's no bad thing!
===
Also, please go check out the amazing @terraternity team! An amazing-looking game exploring themes of ecology and environmental issues. Amazing design and great looking gameplay! 🌎♥️ #boardgames #bgg #tabletop
===
@BowerGameCorner @thegamecrafter Playmats really do add a whole new dimension to games, offering some much-needed organisation along with the benefit of being a super-large canvas to set the mood with some fitting, large-scale artwork! 🌳
===
@HerbertBolanos @RuelGaviola @RollingWithRoc I thought the attachable weapons was such an awesome addition to this game!
===
@ellalovesbg @LederGames The playmat is absolutely gorgeous. Such a great backdrop to an incredible game.
===
@WanMonCast Somehow I immediately thought of Metro X! But I love a good transport puzzler! It looks great 🚄
===
@kovraystudios You're the guys who are working so hard on your creative endeavours - people should rightfully be heaping praise on you! ♥️
===
@oc_casper @BoardGameAcad Twilight Imperium scares me 😅I'm absolutely in love with the look of that game on the table, but I've heard stories of games stretching well into 'days'! I've heard that later editions of that game help to iron out some stalemate conditions and other issues? 🚀
===
@ellalovesbg @Sentieiro @paulosoledade I feel incredibly sorry for any developers who are pre-fulfilment and this container ship is ferrying their entire stock of newly-produced games. Hopefully this doesn't inconvenience anybody too much.
===
@PangeaBG Not because of the state of the world, but Pandemic: The Cure has been to the table a lot recently. However, it's ferociously difficult with just 2 players! A lot of fun though! 🎲
===
@terraternity Absolutely loving the dexterity aspect to this. Such a departure from conventional board game mechanics! 🌎🎲

Since my niece and nephews wanted to open packs with my bro and I. I wanted to know how much are my cards worth? The pic of the list is just a small portion of what I really have. Using https://t.co/Fq6Jp3vMmr, I look up the median price to get my total. https://t.co/T53vesbOrE

1.37% (412,174,996 CRO) of the 30B total supply of CRO is currently delegated via the mainnet. This is great considering there's undoubtedly much more CRO being staked for cards, the exchange, etc. There's even more amazing utility to come with #CRO we're just getting started. https://t.co/db1A5BS6sg

Well AT&amp;T call me with a promotion but the catch is you have to have a eBay credit card if not you have to go out an buy 3 eBay gift cards with a total of $480. in order to get this promotion which you pay ahead 6 months then in you won’t have a bill till September
===
AT&amp;T tells me oh we got a email that you need to upgrade your equipment that’s why you got to go and get three more Best Buy gift cards total amount of $1500 so I said OK on my way out to Best Buy I’ll give AT&amp;T a phone call
===
AT&amp;T tell me again to go out and purchase 3more eBay gift cards in the amount of 486. so I did that’s a total of 6 eBay gift cards so I call AT&amp;T back give them the gift cards Information Then AT&amp;T tells me the eBay gift cards didn’t work I need to go to Best Buy and grab
===
So on my way to Best Buy I’ll give AT&amp;T a phone call at 1-800-288-2020 I speak to them I asked him about this promotion they tell me yes that promotion is a part of us so that gave me the OK to go back out and grab the 3 Best Buy gift cards the total amount of 1500

@shinjukustyles oo u have so many jyushis im jealous, i picked that one up from the anni ssrs, i dont think ive been playing for more than a month tho so i have like 5 cards total lol
===
@StacyConnolly78 Then you can see how many ways you can use 3 cards (1 to 8) to figure out a total of 16 when you're done. Ha ha! 🤷‍♀️😉
===
well, sorry to disappoint, but i couldn't get there. i was blocked by more point missions and unable to clear them. the one i'm currently stuck on requires a total score of 1,000,000, and the only cards i have for that song are c's
===
@RealCandaceO Can only imagine what the other world leaders are thinking!!!
What's ashame is you have to pre-submit questions and he has answers on his little cards!!  Main stream media or puppets play along......total embarrassment!!!!
===
@GGPoker Poker is a card game in which players, with all or part of their hole cards, At the end of the game, the player or players with the best combination of cards wins the total sum of the bets made.

I had a lot of fun trying to make a cube with such a limited card pool (I drafted ~5500 total cards in my pro career). Lots of interesting constraints.
===
@DefiFrank @ether_cards @AttentionToken Here's what I'm observing: 
- 5342 available, out of a total of 9000
- Bonus types
- Every 5th common card https://t.co/3pDTXxhmJq

I HEARD THATS THERES GONNA BE 8 PHOTO CARDS FOR EACH MEMBER SO THAT MAKES 56 PHOTO CARDS IN TOTAL- AND THE ALBUM IS LIKE $150+ THATS HELLA EXPENSIVE PLZZ- #BTS #FilmOutbyBTS
===
@PattyNest @Tanner_Slavin No he shouldn’t. I won a total of 3 cards through the games we played and he beat me with this, I played “Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson”
===
@ColtPython18 He literally read off que cards, and only called on people he had pre planned answers to. At the end he said, "while looking at his que cards" that it looks like he's got one more question left. It was a total joke! The call inns on C Span were comical.
===
@CopiahDawg This is less than 4oz total. The combined shipping should be $0 to at most $1 extra per item. It’s 3 cards. I’ve shipped 30 and it still be below 4oz which is the first price point change on 1st class parcels.
===
5 Spot Razz!! $10 a spot, winner gets shipped these two items: 2021 Topps series 1 fat pack and a Blaster box with 7 packs inside! 139 total Cards!!                           @HobbyConnector @Hobby_Connect @CardPurchaser https://t.co/9znSD2l1AK

Sent in an ‘89 Upper Deck Griffey to PSA that I inspected multiple times with a few other cards. All the other cards came back 10s (4 total) so I know I’m not a complete idiot (debatable). But the Griffey got a 6 which floored me. Must’ve missed something huge in the surface? Idk
===
Another updated 🌈 ISO list. *denotes cards that are on the way. Would love to trade for them(to keep total cost down) but will buy if necessary. RTs are very appreciated! https://t.co/PnmbDGnV2Y

@danoramas @roxannedarling @justinaversano @SuperRare @KnownOrigin_io @niftygateway I followed up on this sale just now &amp; the artist sold out the editions this afternoon &amp; the bid is up to $10,000 for the single animation. $85,000 total.

That is just collectors buying with traditional currency and debit cards?

He appeared to be selling nfts but he wasn’t.
===
I don't think it has dawned on folks that there's gonna be one mystic archive minimum in *every* booster pack. And with only 63 total, I have a feeling this is gonna do wonders for supply of these cards.
===
@BreitbartNews That’s a total lie just like everything he spewed out of his Alzheimer’s mouth today. He was reading off cards for answers that the press asked him how convenient. He’s not in control. They bring them in to read a Teleprompter then send them back down the basement to eat tapioca
===
@POTUS @JoeBiden Well that didn’t happen, your such a liar. Total failure on China this week.Also total failure When you can’t get through a press conference when you’ve prepped for days about the questions. you have your note cards, still can’t get through. you can’t do the job. Border is a mess
===
Hope you #lefts are happy with grandpa as your president. #trump doesn't need cue cards to hold a #bidenpressconference This Grandpa needs to be home, along with #nancy. Both too old to be in office. This is a total embarrassment. #youcausedthis #Democrats
===
@Abi94893411 @Kenya_Simone17 @IncompetentJoe @CantH0LDMe 11 WS and 7 Rings in my life time is more any team outside of St Cards have in total.  Thats more total rings than the Mets appearances in their franchise history.
===

@Megatron1014 it is free, however you must purchase the cards

A woman I know had the 'Stimulate My Mind' playing cards and she wanted to play.

So I consented.  Total waste of money. 

They should be called 'How Ghetto Are You' Cards. 

They are an interesting peek into the inner working of his mind...
===
When I finish up all of the important stuff for my tabletop card game then you'd be able to order a total of 20 cards AND you pick which 1 card gets a gold frame variant
===
There are 21 cards in total and I'll let you choose which 1 card should have a gold frame. I just have to get all the cards onto one promo image now

Just got done playing @MTG_Arena on my iPhone 11 Pro for the last half hour. Some frame drops (especially cards moving from hand to board), and I’d love the life total to be on my avatar like @MagicOnline so it doesn’t block my hand.

But overall? Not bad. Not bad at all. https://t.co/ItyzqHXYWN
===
@SavaniaGames I have never had that 'gotta collect' mentality, it's why I don't really back many Kickstarters, but this comic speaks to me for reasons that I'll often buy a game I'm excited about but not actually play it for ages (streaming has changed that a little thankfully!)

@SavaniaGames @FFGames Eldritch Horror, I remember looking at it in the store one day and thinking to myself that it seemed like a simpler version of Arkham Horror; I remember thinking about getting it but ultimately we shy'd away from it; it's still a possibility we might look at it again.
===
That sounds exciting. We'll have to dig a little deeper on our end. Although we have a collection of well over 100 #boardgames- and many we've not played - I'm always excited to expand. It's good for content, and that's the plan! Suggestions welcome! #boardgamegeek #tabletopgames https://t.co/MELPtnBisv
===
@SavaniaGames @FFGames I have briefly seen the newest edition of Arkham Horror (online) but did not pay it any close mind (probably because of the previous experience). We do own Elder Sign, and have been tempted by Mansions of Madness.
===
@SavaniaGames I'll have to descend into the dungeon to snag a shot. 😄
===
Darkest Night 'eh? Might have to take a look at that one. I know one of our Roll-and-go is Sushi Go. It's probably the easiest game we have in our cabinet to teach. (Base game, not Party variants) https://t.co/waHDgJbcTf
===
@SavaniaGames @atlasgames I think we've experienced all of them... Until we got an exclusive room for boardgames that they can't get in. Now they just perform Cat Opera outside... Especially when the camera is live
===
@SavaniaGames @atlasgames I agree wholeheartedly. But I don't know if our two furballs are quite as magical... Or are they... 😼

===
@TheRaichu_ Ooo good choice! I definitely splurged to buy it, but it fits so well in my Zedruu EDH deck! 
I’m really enjoying building this deck because you can fit so many weird and bad cards into it, like giving your opponents Form of the Dragon to make their life total 5 and much more &gt;:3 https://t.co/0oh9e74t6v

@POTUS @VP That was not a true Press Conference. What happened to total transparency and working together? If you all can't be honest with the American people &amp; answer questions without planned questions &amp; cheat cards or on the fly then what is the point? Who's vision is it then?

@Champersq1 @giles_fraser @Fox_Claire Insert your own joke about making sure your balls stay sanitised! My local pub had a table tennis table in garden and had to stop issuing bats and balls for that reason.

It’s shameful that we are judging our own president by if he can make it through the whole thing and how long will it last and will he look at cue cards. Its as if the press has accepted they have a president who is not qualified and is a total joke.
===
I don’t think they will, it would make 95% of the cards in the game obsolete, tank the market worse than ever before, and they would run out of cards to put out, There’s not enough 6’10+ players to go around. At that point it’s just a total arcade game mode lol https://t.co/VQUIzYRYwv

A total I will never have... because I'm poor.
===
@JeezumCrowe Honestly, not as many as I wish I had. We couldn't afford a lot of them when I was a kid and then I fell off for years.

Estimation would be in the tens of thousands for total cards. Unique cards?  Maybe 1000?

Looking through my old ones is still really nostalgic though.

If you look at credit cards from a JTBD lens you'll find lending is not really the problem they're solving for anymore. The last thing I would 'hire' a credit card for is borrowing money. BNPL only competes with the revolving utility of credit cards (45% of total CC debt)

@brandtgate Of course the shield increase to G1s would've only gone so far, which is why I think they should've not just cut down on the G-zone total again, but also cut down on the power gain from the heart card on Stride, make it less necessary to use so many cards to guard with.

@csuwildcat @dak3 @Steve_Lockstep @Engbrg @iang_fc @IdentityWoman @blogisch @chriswinc @james_monaghan @mdudas @truu_id @Tykn_tech @mydataorg @brent_zundel An anonymous bearer token *is* a credential.  And there are LOTS of them.  Far more payment cards are anonymous gift cards than identified credit and debit cards - though the total balance is much greater on the identified cards.

For Hard Mode, you need to have 50%-40% more total strength then the opponent's. The example shown here is 40% more than the opponent's.

Focus on upgrading the cards that are advantageous towards the attributes shown on each level's top right-hand corner.

@Top8Games Nice! Canlander folks have maintained a budget-based format and I've always found it a fascinating compromise. 'Budget' doesn't have to mean total price. It could also mean limiting the quantity of cards in a given price tier. Maybe that's getting too cute.

@ArielHal9000 @Typhirz @Waratworld17 @KnowingBetterYT Exactly like that. Provoking a crackdown is a classic insurgency tactic, and often works even better if you're non-violent (but that's not always an option). Polled support for BLM went up significantly during the protests.
===
@ArielHal9000 @Typhirz @Waratworld17 @KnowingBetterYT If a revolution ever had to be fought again in the US, it would be asymmetric warfare and rioting, designed to provoke a police or military crackdown. On some level the point wouldn't be to stop the drones, it would be to get the drones to fire on US citizens, on US soil.
===
@IiiPattyboi @ArielHal9000 @Typhirz @Waratworld17 @KnowingBetterYT My broader point is that there *are* some resistance and last-resort revolution strategies that are enhanced by an armed populace, or are impossible without it. Fighting a direct war with the US military wouldn't be viable, but also wouldn't be the goal.
===
@ArielHal9000 @Typhirz @Waratworld17 @KnowingBetterYT The ultimate goal would be to broaden popular support by exposing brutality, and to provoke the leaders into giving orders that won't be followed, causing parts of the military to defect or smuggle equipment to the rebels.
===
@IiiPattyboi @ArielHal9000 @Typhirz @Waratworld17 @KnowingBetterYT Like I said before - "but that's not always an option".

It definitely wouldn't be in the full revolution/state collapse scenario we're talking about here.

@OvieO As it did with the first film. I love the Snyder Cut but it wouldn't make sense if a 4 hour film were to be divided in theaters. It would strategically cost the studios more. MARVEL played their best cards and did all of that in the IW and EG with that total runtime.

@Typhirz @Waratworld17 @KnowingBetterYT What the fuck are a few dozen or even hundred guys going to do against the most expensive military in the world. How is a redneck with an AR-15 supposed to keep in check an arsenal of drones.

@Evaderix @Typhirz @Waratworld17 @KnowingBetterYT How are you going to compare Vietnam or Mexico to the power that is the US military industrial complex. We probably armed half of those nations to fight each other after destabilizing them. We go into wars just so they can get some new government contracts.
===
@Typhirz @Waratworld17 @KnowingBetterYT So maybe the document should reflect how things have changed. Maybe instead of including a revolution button we could implement better checks on the government while making voting more democratic and fair so we never have to resort to needing an armed insurrection.

@SavaniaGames @AdeptLibrarium @bushontheradio As there should be😉

@SavaniaGames @AdeptLibrarium @bushontheradio That's an ace collection!

example: astro's all yours vs skz' i am you

all yours has 1 message card per album and 2 pcs. in total there is 3 message cards per member and 6 pcs. so if you buy all 3 versions, you have enough pcs and message cards to get every pc to collect 1 member.

If #Sorare is around is 15 years, who could have more total cards minted than Kylian Mbappe? Obviously there are younger players with cards, but will they play long enough to pass Mbappe? Guessing the quick responses will be someone like Noa Lang or CDK.

P1H can put number cards in order from smallest to biggest and from biggest to smallest, ascending and descending in 10’s . They also practised adding, then used this skill to find the total value of some coins. #powerofplean https://t.co/AumW76Ej9r

Of course, now I have way too many cards on my board (271 in total). I just moved the problem, but I still feel it's more maintainable on the Kanban board that it is in the browser. And with the summary on the card, triaging them will be easier.

Even non-sports cards are going crazy. 🤑 A Jay-Z autographed card is going for a record-breaking total.

How much debt is too much?  Unsecured debt should be under 20%.  As a homeowner, or looking toward owning a home, you should try to keep the total debt-to-income ratio under 45% (this includes credit cards, medical, student loans, car payments, personal loans, &amp; mortgage payment) https://t.co/yjXCJ2W8RZ

@SavaniaGames Thank you so much!

@Sifill_LDF @HC_Richardson HR 1. Total BS. Of course we can have COVID cards but gosh an id is suppression. Tokyo Rose,  aka HRC, knows it too. An elitist fraud. No? Whatcha think? Power. It tastes good right? @mtaibbi @ggreenwald
