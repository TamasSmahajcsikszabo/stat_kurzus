And there we go! The tower is finished. I have been making a few of these as I test new ideas on assembling and finishing them.
This one is being sent to a friend. She wanted to play D&amp;D so I helped her get a PH &amp; dice.

Dice tower designed, &amp; laser cut (thanks @ponokohq).  5th experimental one. Design works fine &amp; now testing with assembly. Bamboo veneer, with cherry stain. And had my d20 logo laser-etched to see how that worked out. #dicetower #DnD https://t.co/COM6aXGcMd

Today we felt the new dice tower. Does it need it? No, but it really softens the sound of dice rolling. I've used brused on, and spray on glues and in the end? Self-adhesive felt works just as well and is MUCH easier to trim and apply. #dicetower #dnd #rpgs #dungeonsanddragons https://t.co/SW8c7NTA4K

Dice tower felting went faster than expected. The adhesive backed felt really speeds things up. Went ahead and glued it up. Applied rubber bands so it all goes together straight. Leave it overnight then remove the bands. Then we're done.
