@DeffersonJ @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp No it doesn't. Believe what you want, but the good Father is not questioning the inerrancy of scripture. He is questioning our fallible interpretation of it

@1onlybillyshea1 @KStateTurk @cxpage @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Because maps are flat you think the earth is flat?
===
@DeffersonJ @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp Do you believe slavery is a sin? Even though the Bible condones it? Even though the church condoned it for 1500 years before declaring it sinful?

I don't presume to know the mind of God.

So, you drive a car with airbags, seatbelts, and crumple zones? Got it..but now you're angry at me for driving drunk as I present a danger to you? So does that imply they don't work?

Yes, your post is #sodumb https://t.co/S3WZHLVcYx

@londonabstract @AngeliFrankie @darius_nau @DivocSuriv The keystone of science is objectivity. Allopathic medicine is based on the principles of try and error, not on objectivity. The applied theories, like the germ theory, have tried extensively and the result is an error.

===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 A mathematical construct, thank you for the confirmation. Light bending does not indicate a gravitational field nor spacetime nor spacetime curvature. Do you know what an experiment is?
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Wrong again. https://t.co/mgrECwqBCH

@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Not submissable - this is not a demonstration of general relativity, the only (colloquial) "theory" consistent with observation. https://t.co/kXAZTiSYcv

I am simply telling you that what you assert is not possible, based on logical deduction applying the laws of thermodynamics, space is fake to be precise.

@doctorbuttons @cxpage @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 To paraphrase Lennon, nothing is real (in mathematics).

Inertial forces are not real nor real effects, by definition. A pseudo/fictional/fictitious/imaginary force cannot also be a real force or cause a real effect or be anything real. https://t.co/Gn0wiFkLVL

===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Not possible. Your claim is an open system. The atmosphere would fill the space.
===
@cxpage @doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 A disappointing approach.
===
@KStateTurk @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Not an experiment. Sure the distances are consistent. But the map is flat, hardly proof of your own claim. You must show how the distances as arcs across a sphere are measured then projected onto a flat surface.
===
@doctorbuttons @cxpage @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 1) Centrifugal force is a real effect in a non inertial reference frame.

2) centrifugal force is a fictitious force.

Mutually exclusive. Feel free to show where I misrepresent or misunderstand.
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 That's the spirit, keep the sheep in line. You do have a habit of confusing them completely though.
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 On a related matter, question: IF sun has a bigger radius - therefore greater distance to it, greater earth orbit, faster orbit, faster axial rotation, shorter day..? While radius is indy of angular speed, it seems not intuitive that earth radius can remain constant in this case.
===
@doctorbuttons @cxpage @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Nobody is forcing you to go over anything. Though it generally helps to clarify positions when you do.
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 A little old for that aren't you?
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Nothing here resembles physics. You need experimental verification for your claim relating to the horizon appearing as it does in the image. And citation for 'horizon is a physical occluding boundary caused by curvature'.
===
@ianfmusgrave @doctorbuttons @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Sure. https://t.co/fAKbpuYb7s

@KStateTurk @cxpage @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Really? How?
===
@KStateTurk @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 If this is reality then we live on some pacman/donkey kong (to a more obscure extent popeye on the c64) world where moving off the side lands you immediately on the opposite side.

Ah wait, you said "represents". Ie, not reality.
===
@doctorbuttons @cxpage @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Citation required. Here's mine: https://t.co/2jRpqe9K3G
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Then one hour would be a significant problem.
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Assertion without experiment is nothing to do with physics, was my point. You need an experiment, or at least a demonstration, to show this horizon effect you claim. You also do need a citation to support a definition which is contrary to how the term is defined in common use.
===
@KStateTurk @cxpage @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 You mean maps being flat and me thinking earth is flat? Not a proof but hardly a self debunk either.
===
@provaxtexan @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Yes, images of objects being raised above the horizon. That is not the claim in the image above known as 'black swan'.
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 They got something correct. But since they don't know what an experiment is, this train wreck pseudoscience a case in point, they will fail at that aswell. https://t.co/4PYunbdvyV
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Am seeing special pleading however.
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Do you "believe in gravity?
Do you have evidence for that belief?
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Angular size is directly measurable, it cannot be changed beyond slightly more accurate measurement or seasonal variation. The question is hypothetical. Should the sun size be changed, this would impact on all the factors above, and perhaps earth radius, or not earth radius.
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 No you don't.
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Such is the claim. What I want to know is the accuracy of it.
===
@ianfmusgrave @KStateTurk @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Sure, it's a map/projection/model. Not reality.
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 That may be so, but on Mars? No, absolutely unequivocally not on Mars that is sheer cultist dogma.
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 No it's special pleading. A gas pressure cannot be maintained by a gravitational field. Except in this assertion. For which there is no evidence.
===
@SimonTe53732612 @doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram You haven't lived.
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Assumption of R, but more pressingly you need a demonstration to support the effect described by AT Young.
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 You don't know the radius of the sun to any degree of accuracy.
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 There is a reason gravity is not compatible with quantum mechanics. One consists of verified hypotheses, the other has no hypothesis. Newton himself stated as much. And Einstein, no, there is no hypothesis for spacetime bending.
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 No, gravity is not a container. Citation and example to support, required.
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Can't have a gas pressure without a container.
===
@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Nope. You confuse them and I expose the contradictions you assert.
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Not seeing evidence of spacetime, curvature of spacetime, said curvature causing motion, maintaining gas pressure next to a vacuum etc.

@doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 More triggered induced ad hom. And special pleading.
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Ah, so it is not a force? That's interesting. You cannot cite evidence for gravity, it is a mathematical construct.
===
@ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 They "leave Earth's atmosphere and enter a vaccum increasing to the value of 10^-17 Torr" correct?
===

@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Name one. Go. 100% this will trace to a misunderstanding on your part.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 We know the radius of the sun to an accuracy of better than 0.05% so this line of argument is sterile.
===
@ianfmusgrave @1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 That claim is obvious nonsense.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Refraction of light has nothing to do with physics? Just listen to yourself. 

A horizon in this context is an occluding boundary. It is self evidently so. I do not accept your casual hand wave via diversion into pointless semantics.

@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 I‚Äôm not going to go over all this again. You know damn well that inertial forces are a real effect, both mathematically and as experienced in real life. Pointless semantic quibbling to cover over the things that embarrass the already toe curling embarrassing belief in flat earth.

@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 I know it to better than 0.05%
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Sounds like plus or minus one hour to me. Eclipse timings can be predicted to the second.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 To remind you - light refraction places the horizon at point H. Point H is a physical location beyond which objects become hidden from O due to the interposed surface represented by S to H. https://t.co/Xuqt3h2XNe
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 You‚Äôve set off on a wrong premise. If the sun was marginally larger, resulting in a longer than expected eclipse (I strongly have my doubts) then that would indicate it has a larger than expected angular size. So it doesn‚Äôt follow it has a larger range. Please try to think.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 No. It was a rebuke, an insult, a correction to a misstatement and a celebration of an ironical self debunk.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 No. I just have a habit of confusing you. Or maybe you just confuse yourself.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 R is my claim, not an assumption you blithering idiot. The demonstration was never better given than in your precious Black Swan image, which, in the most delicious of ironies, turned out to actually debunk flat earth when somebody competent eventually bothered to analyse it. üòÇ

@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 They‚Äôre not mutually exclusive.

You‚Äôre welcome.
===
@RealEarthParty @TheYoungTurks I live in an affluent community &amp; apparently most who do not have ID, tend to be poor and/or rural. So, no I don't have specific examples.

Do you think poor/rural US citizens should be able to vote?

Do you disbelieve everything, unless you know someone who has experienced it?
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti Being from Michigan, I know several people who winter in Florida (Snowbirds).

By their accounts, what you're saying about it being like the pandemic "never even happened", is completely untrue.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti Because we're experiencing multiple times the annual deaths from common flus &amp; colds combined.

Here's where you give your spiel about COVID deaths being fabricated, which you're wrong about. 

My own independent research confirms the accuracy of the public data, so save it.
===
@RealEarthParty @gettysburgaddr2 @Vleermuissnacks @naomirwolf Here's the actual quote, similar to what she said publicly multiple times, which you have parroted, "It‚Äôs the Smartmatic and Dominion systems that were built to do this very thing, for changing the results of elections".
https://t.co/6LKWs1ga8u
===
@RealEarthParty @gettysburgaddr2 @Vleermuissnacks @naomirwolf I also love how now that Powell admits she repeatedly made false statements about a coordinated effort to rig the election, you suddenly want primary sources for quotes.

You know damn well what she was saying, because you were peddling her "evidence", which amounted to bullshit.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti What if, by midsummer only unvaccinated people are hospitalized or dying from COVID? 

Will that be enough to convince you?
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti Then I will shit bricks, since I'm scheduled to get vaccinated next week.

I answered your question, now please answer mine.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti Then why aren't FoxNews, Rudy &amp; Sydney, using your defense?

Answer; they know if the Dominion lawsuit goes to trial, there's ZERO chance they can prove their claims...because they aren't real...never happened.

I really hope there's a trial, just to prove all the Q-nuts wrong.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti If you wholeheartedly still believed the election was stolen, you wouldn't have completely stopped posting about it two months ago.

When I'm proven wrong, I admit &amp; own it. You should try it.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti Apparently you did not see my other replies, specifically about FLORIDA...

While your state has an advantage of being able to have most activities in the open air, which is less risky, you're completely exaggerating how well things have gone down there.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti I'm wondering when you will realize the conspiracy narratives you currently believe about the pandemic, are also FALSE. 

Similar to how you apparently came to the conclusion that Flat Earther &amp; Qanon theories are actually bullshit.

NOT FACTUAL, just what you WANT to BELIEVE.
===
@RealEarthParty @TheYoungTurks And what "other things" are you referencing, which can be used as valid ID, in states with voter ID laws?

What did the US do for 100 years before the first photo IDs were available?

Do you think Republicans can win if all citizens are registered &amp; provided with valid voter IDs?
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti Hmm, Florida's first surge: Early summer 2020.

I'm not "telling you" anything, I'm saying your generalized statements have been refuted by people I know &amp; trust.

So, either your experience is vastly different than theirs, you're exaggerating for effect or are outright lying.
===
@RealEarthParty @TheYoungTurks "Although a large majority of Americans have a government-issued photo ID, many surveys show that a small percentage, equating to millions of Americans, do not. Some studies show that minority communities hold photo IDs at lower rates".
https://t.co/J4hskAqBfM
===
@RealEarthParty @TheYoungTurks I'm all for implementing a federal plan to get every US citizen government issued identification AND registered to vote.

One guess as to which party has thwarted every effort to make this happen?

And what's their rationale for this?
If that happens, we won't win elections. https://t.co/ivzKM0OHqD
===
@RealEarthParty @TheYoungTurks Guess how many Congressional Republicans currently support this bill...not a single one.

They say it's because of this bullshit reason or that bullshit reason.

But the truth is, they know if turnout goes up, they probably lose.
===
@RealEarthParty @TheYoungTurks @spreaker Um yeah, probably not good to brag about there being no pandemic in a state with over 2M confirmed cases (3rd highest) &amp; 33K deaths (4th highest).

It's almost like your state, where outdoor activities can happen year around, has serious issues around the holidays (indoors). https://t.co/3qMCpOMO3P
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti I think you know damn well Trump lost, but you committed so heavily to the Big Lie, that you're embarrassed to admit the truth...maybe even to yourself.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti Again, hyperbole. NO ONE is claiming this is a plague. 

So, everything you say after that word is invalid.
===
@RealEarthParty @TheYoungTurks Yes, multiple Congressional bills have been proposed over the years to provide all adult US CITIZENS with valid ID AND automatically registered to vote.

The bills go nowhere, because GOP controlled states believe elections should be run only by them, with no federal involvement.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti No, my point is that when one conspiracy theory doesn't pan out for you, the go-to tactic of the right is to double down on another.

You were CONVINCED that election fraud would be proven, but it wasn't...not even close.

Simply pointing out that hurts your overall credibility.
===
@RealEarthParty @gettysburgaddr2 @Vleermuissnacks @naomirwolf You're missing key points of the definition; it must be new, spread worldwide &amp; have severe outcomes in significant parts of the population.

Colds do not meet 2 of those 3 criteria.

It's conceivable a new flu or cold strain COULD meet the criteria, but haven't for some time.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti Unsurprisingly, those I know who have had it, were those who were the most lax in following CDC guidelines, which each-&amp;-every one of them now regret.

In fact my boss &amp; all 3 of her kids have it right now (1 kid got at school). All have symptoms, though not severe at this point.
===
@RealEarthParty @TheYoungTurks @spreaker In addition, I'll go a little conspiratorial on you now...with DeSantis presiding over your state's reporting, I'm not so sure we can believe the data being publicly released.

How do you KNOW whether or not he's suppressing accurate information?
===
@RealEarthParty @TheYoungTurks Seriously, that's your rebuttal? 

If someone doesn't have a state issued ID, what do you think the likelihood is that they have a university student ID or a passport?

Absolutely ridiculous. 

Doesn't matter what evidence is provided, you simply refuse to modify your beliefs.
===
@RealEarthParty @gettysburgaddr2 @Vleermuissnacks @naomirwolf Powell was saying this kind of crap left &amp; right for 2 months after the election, which you FULLY BOUGHT INTO at the time.
But now, "no reasonable person would conclude that the statements [Powell made about election fraud] were truly statements of fact".
https://t.co/zZmcpAfVxD
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti By the way, when did you start using the words "plague" &amp; "supervirus" in your COVID arguments? I know of no media outlets using either term.

Also don't recall you using such hyperbole in the past, when we've bantered about this topic. Ramping up the labels for dramatic effect?
===
@RealEarthParty @gettysburgaddr2 @Vleermuissnacks @naomirwolf I provided the evidence you requested. 

Do you at least admit she repeatedly &amp; knowingly lied about Dominion voting machine fraud, for political purposes? Because that is exactly what the motion to dismiss, filed on her behalf, clearly states.

For which she will be disbarred.
===
@RealEarthParty @gettysburgaddr2 @Vleermuissnacks @naomirwolf My favorite part from page 32:

Reasonable people understand that the ‚Äúlanguage of the political arena, like the language 
used in labor disputes ‚Ä¶ is often vituperative, abusive and inexact.‚Äù

Basically, if you believed her rhetoric as factual, you're an unreasonable person.
===
@RealEarthParty @TheYoungTurks Unfortunate for them, Article 1 Section 4 of the Constitution, clearly provides Congress with the authority to regulate national elections.

For the People Act (2021 Voting Rights Act), ensures all citizens get valid ID AND automatically registered to vote, unless they decline.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti Well if you don't know anyone that's had it, then it must not be real. That's some warped logic!

I know dozens of people who have had it, including multiple family members, some with long lasting symptoms &amp; 3 acquaintances who have died from it.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti I know what it isn't...similar to the flu.

Who is calling it a supervirus? No one is trying to say this is as deadly as Ebola or Smallpox, just more contagious. 

However, it DEFINITELY has a much higher mortality rate than "common" flus or colds.
===
@RealEarthParty @robinmonotti Biased hyperbole &amp; patently false statements.
===
@RealEarthParty @TheYoungTurks @spreaker And no, it's nothing like the Black Plague, so you would not be tripping over dead bodies, but it definitely has higher occurrences of severe outcomes, including death, than other "common" contagious diseases.

Have you ever heard of people having cold/flu symptoms for months?
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Fact Check: We know exactly how long the 2017 eclipse lasted and it was as predicted.

@ianfmusgrave @1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Crap.  Yeah.  Diameter.  I swear his dumbassery is rubbing off on me.  Q

===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 The claim is utter bullshit and if you believe it without any other evidence that‚Äôs a shame.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 The accuracy of that claim is absolute zero.

If you wish to continue entertainming it you will need to provide some data to back it up.

Even the idiots who made the video don‚Äôt appear to be standing by the claim.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Amazing how he can post a description of something he has undoubtedly experienced and then deny its existence.
===
@ianfmusgrave @doctorbuttons @1onlybillyshea1 @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Very true.

There are always people lurking and they will see a nut job who's grasp of science and indeed reality is tenuous at best spouting bullshit being rebutted by science.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 There's only one person here who seems confused.

===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 So now it‚Äôs back to duration of the eclipse.

It‚Äôs fascinating how you can‚Äôt even keep your own bullshit claims straight.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 1,390,000 km.

That's one million, three hundred ninety kilometers.

That's the radius of the sun.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Let's do a quick poll.

Have you ever been confused by Doc Buttons?

@cxpage @1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 &lt;SFX: polite cough&gt; That‚Äôs the diameter (+/- 280 Km uncertainty)
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 yes, we know it to within a few seconds of arc.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Actual helicopter
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Here is a video from one of the GOES satellites, you can calculate the eclipse duration from the time stamps https://t.co/NrPzNCH2gh
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 And that container is gravity (do you think the atmospheres of Venus, Jupiter, Saturn etc are illusions)?
===
@doctorbuttons @1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 He can't, but the lurkers can (and might learn something cool)
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @KStateTurk @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Yes, the reality is that the earth is a sphere, and the projection is one way to represent the sphere as a flat surface, you blithely claiming that Google maps shows the world as flat ignores the fact that the flatness is an artificial construct.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 The only way fro the length of the eclipse to change is if the suns angular diameter is larger. The claim was the eclipse would be one hour longer, which meant proportionally the eclipse length over the continental US should have been 20 minutes longer. It wasn‚Äôt.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Wether you believe in gravity or not, we have measure the atmospheric demystify from sea level of low earth orbit to geostationary orbit out to interplanetary space.
===
@doctorbuttons @1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Easily, don‚Äôt forget rounding errors. And it‚Äôs nothing like the 20 minutes longer the one hour longer total eclipse length claim would require.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @KStateTurk @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 It‚Äôs called a sphere.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 And it‚Äôs a cutie https://t.co/rKwyWxxiWG
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 No, it's actual measurement, real data trumps your preconceptions.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Again, here are a bunch more, calculating the duration from the time stamps is a bit more challenging but doable https://t.co/14oxVYQy31
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 There‚Äôs this thing called gravity, you may have heard of it, you obviously have never climbed a tall mountain and noticed the air is thinner, or flown in a plane or a high altitude ballon where the air is thinners still. That the atmosphere thins with height was well known 1/2
===
@doctorbuttons @1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 For so many reasons, yet convincing Billy will be a task akin to pulling teeth.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 No, you are seeing actual measured atmospheric densities, that are I‚Äôm almost any textbook on atmosphere physics.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 You already know it is wrong.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 .. by the 18th century. And of course we have all the observations of vacuum from sounding rockets (I live in the same state as Woomera) orbital satellites and deep space probes. You may want to pretend they don‚Äôt exist, but we have a helicopter on Mars. 2/2
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Aside from actual demonstrations of gravity (ever since Cavendish), gravitational lensing, frame dragging etc. https://t.co/aQas0tRQHs
https://t.co/GydzRsFfCS
https://t.co/udizmu4wWB.
https://t.co/PDXf1Mbm7j
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 I don't "believe" in gravity, I accept the overwhelming evidence for gravity and the Einsteinian conception of it.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Day length is independent of orbital location, eg Mars, much further out with a year almost double earths has a day almost identical. Venus, much closer in with a year much shorter than Earths has a day length almost equal to it‚Äôs year.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Again, as I love in the same state as Woomera, the University of Adelaide sent up sounding rockets to the edge of space, above the atmosphere to do X-ray astronomy. And don‚Äôt forget SOFIA, the plane which flys an IR telescope above the bulk of the atmosphere.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Around the Sun, that‚Äôs what orbiting the sun means (or orbiting their target planet)
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Yes, they leave the earth's atmosphere and into interplanetary space. Then enter into orbit around the Sun.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @doctorbuttons @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Simple denial will get you nowhere, I have already posted the data. Multiple determinations since the 18th Century.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @KStateTurk @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Sorry for your delicate sensibilities, but the helicopter ingenuity is right there on Mars (along with Perseverance, Curiosity and a whole swatch of Mars orbiters). You may not like it, but it's true.

@C_Bailey1971 @robinmonotti Well, if there's really a plague, then it wouldn't stay secret from anyone.  There's be no one able to escape noticing it.  There wouldn't be a debate over whether or not it's happening.
===
@C_Bailey1971 @robinmonotti The million dollar question is: What is "it"?

How do you know that what they have is a brand-new supervirus from Wuhan?

If they have the flu, I wish them a speedy recovery, but it's not exactly newsworthy.
===
@lesliejmarshall @randomperson_FA @abotmanx @zeynepyenisey That was probably the flu, exacerbated by immunosuppression induced by lockdown and the mask.

But I'm glad you're ok.
===
@C_Bailey1971 @robinmonotti First of all, no one's outside in Florida during the summer. It's all indoors, with AC and recirculation.

Second of all, I find it funny that you're telling me what's going on, around me, from 1500 miles away.
===
Whoa. https://t.co/3Ve7U6CkpE
===
@C_Bailey1971 @robinmonotti If there's a once-a-century plague, it's impossible to not be affected by it. Everyone would either catch it, or at least know someone who caught it (and died).

And the state that did nothing to stop it would fare the worst of all.

Instead, the lockdowniest states fared worst.
===
@c_makeba Worse like what?
===
@Awithonelison @essentialsteez @doritmi I'll let you in on a little secret.

Lean in closely...

...

The people who do fill out the certificates...

...according to protocols...

...set BY governments.

Shocking, I know.

(And the government, in turn, is controlled by corporations, FYI).
===

@AlexandrovnaIng Being well-adjusted to a sick society is not an achievement...
===
@_BUNNSY_ So common sense is "rightwing" now.
===
@C_Bailey1971 @robinmonotti Lol, you forget, I'm in Florida - the state that did absolutely zero to slow the spread of the most contagious and deadly plague in 100 years, and society went on as if nothing were amiss. No bodies lining the streets. Nobody knows any victims. Nothing. Completely normal year.
===
@C_Bailey1971 @robinmonotti How do you know it has a higher mortality rate?
===
It ends as soon as enough of us say NO. https://t.co/uUQnEcw708
===
@R_Good_Fellow @doritmi You're forgetting... the people you're talking to WANT sterility.

They want to give puberty-blockers to children, so that there are no girls, no boys, and no gender.

This is what they WANT.

You're like "but but, it'll do THAT to you!"

But they WANT that.
===
@PerhapsABot @BobbyAllenWolf @doritmi Yes, I know, because that's part of the Scientific Method.

Step 9:

"If someone presents a hypothesis that contradicts your current beliefs, DO NOT, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, debate them on it.  Just call them stupid, and carry on believing what you believe."

@HalVolta @FreckledLiberty @davidmweissman @lpky The whole point of NeverAgain is so that when it starts Happening Again, you‚Äôll notice and nip it in the bud.

I would seriously reconsider my beliefs.

===
@BookishDM @doritmi But cooperating with the establishment of a permanent totalitarian techno-fascist medical dystopia is not selfish at all.
===
@C_Bailey1971 @robinmonotti Election fraud happened, and it's proven by the fact that no public debate was ever held on it.

If you're charged with a crime, and the state refuses to give you a trial, then according to international human rights law, you are innocent for all legal purposes.
===
@C_Bailey1971 @robinmonotti I mean it's like literally nothing unusual happened in 2020.

Zero mitigation. Zero plague.

I don't know anyone within 3 degrees of Kevin Bacon who even *caught* it, nevermind got hospitalized or died from it, except for one friend of a friend of a friend - and that was in NY!
===
@PerhapsABot @BobbyAllenWolf @doritmi Thinking that calling someone stupid constitutes a rational rebuttal of their argument, is stupid.
===
@C_Bailey1971 @robinmonotti Florida has been completely normal from the start. You walk around, and you're living in a society in which 2020 never occurred. Just never even happened.

Explain that.

Breaking the curse = wildly unpredictable results!

@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp Jimmy doesn‚Äôt believe sodomy is a sin you idiot. He pushes acceptance of homosexuality in the Church, one of the only sins that cries to heaven for vengeance. Active sodomites need to be healed via confession and remission of sins, as the Saint says. This requires repentance
===
@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp And St Paul calls on us to publicly rebuke error and those who promote it.

So if you accept scriptures inerrancy, which Father Martin brings to question by sharing an article claiming that scripture ‚Äúcan be corrected‚Äù, do you then accept God &amp; St Paul on homosexuality?
===
@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp Which part of it does he claim we have fallibly interpreted falsely? Mother Church is the only authoritative interpreter of scripture, need I remind you? She has always condemned homosexuality as intrinsically sinful. Do you agree with her?
===
@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp And yes, the ‚Äúgood father‚Äù (LOL), posted an article with the opening line questioning scriptures inerrancy, as well as later on claiming that the Bible needs to ‚Äúbe corrected‚Äù
===
@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp Slavery isn't sinful, intrinsically. The Church has condemned it as unnecessary and no longer appropriate, but never intrinsically, at all times and places, evil. Such a judgement is not possible with homosexuality, as it has been condemned as sinful by God, whereas God....
===
@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp This thoroughly refutes your entire modernist premise. https://t.co/87Us3pKmgB
===
@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp Do you believe that homosexual acts are intrinsically sinful?

Clearly anyone with a brain can see that ‚ÄúFather‚Äù Jimmy is sparking conversation about St Paul possibly being wrong.
===
@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp No, if you go to confession you are actually not in sin until you commit another. Same with immediately post-baptism.

Father Martin however attempts to ‚Äúminister‚Äù to sodomites without any calls for repentance and conversion to save their souls. He betrays Christ
===
@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp Also, you don't have to presume, you idiot. Scripture is crystal clear on the topic and Christ's one true Church has repeatedly condemned sodomy as sinful. Where's the ambiguity?
===
@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp ...allowed slavery, commanded slaves submit to their masters, etc. However the Church has the authority to say, that while not always evil, slavery is no longer necessary or appropriate for society.
===
@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp He is literally promoting the view that St Paul might be wrong about homosexuality because of slavery in scripture. You‚Äôre blind if you don‚Äôt see this as questioning the inerrancy of scripture
===
@provaxtexan @JamesMartinSJ @usccbp He said St Paul might be wrong about sodomites, are you stupid? https://t.co/2jBS4nAZxa

===
@IreneMavrakakis @CJBowden1 @PointOaligned My first thought, sounds very similar to SJ syndrome. Rare but awful!
===
@IreneMavrakakis @CJBowden1 @PointOaligned SJS came to mind when I read his story as well. Unfortunately it can happen with commonly-used (and usually issue-free) medications like antibiotics &amp; NSAIDs.
===
@MommaHen5555 @IreneMavrakakis @PointOaligned Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a rare, serious disorder of the skin and mucous membranes. It's usually a reaction to medication that starts with flu-like symptoms, followed by a painful rash that spreads and blisters.

@provaxtexan Life expectancy increased due to running water, sanitation, antibiotics, and IV therapies. Vaccines have never been tested clinically and no contagion theory has ever been proven clinically. Post a study or keep your talking points to yourself.

@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Oh for pity's sake:  Look up #HitchensRazor! 

It's blatantly obvious that you don't understand that what you're reading is anti-scientific and fear-mongering crap. Your "research" has been totally lopsided &amp; hasn't incorporated any of the *legitimate* research.
===
@DraganOrlich @Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Or perhaps just plain old arrogance born out of a deep well of ignorance?
===
@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes So anyone who is wondering what the scientific truth is knows that what you're saying can't be trusted bc you have not nor will you be able to, **back it up with hard evidence**. You don't realise that you've only read the written for low reading age crap from vested interests. https://t.co/y1zVUSZvMB

@Truckdriverkw @mcfunny @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes WTAF does that have to do with *vaccination*??

@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes What a silly thing to say when it's you who will be completely vulnerable to original &amp; mutated viruses.
===
@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes I deliberately asked if she was paid in the hope that you would realise how pathetic *your* claims that we pro-health advocates are paid by Pharma are. Think about it.
===
@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes You talk about the "ego" of others when you reject the entirety of the scientific literature in favour of your pet theories?
===
@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes That lady is qualified to be a holocaust survivor and she's entitled to have an opinion. However that does not excuse her ignorance about the need for vaccination, and nor does her opinion outweigh the *evidence*.
===
@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Your "freedom" in relation to airborne particles &amp; aerosols, stops 1.5 metres from my face, and *also* in the surrounding air where your aerosols remain in the air for a couple of hours. You are not entitled to the "freedom" to infect others.
===
@DraganOrlich @Truckdriverkw @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Indeed. That poor old lady was a **child** during the Holocaust. I'm glad she survived, millions didn't. That's why it's a travesty for the Holocaust to be used as a comparator because COVID-19 has killed more than 1 million so far.
===
@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes There you go again - sucked in by anti-vax crap. You haven't noticed the preponderance of healthcare professionals/scientists on the thread? We have a *professional* responsibility to uphold the very sound &amp; proven methods of disease *prevention*, and to **EDUCATE** ppl like you
===
@MsTrixter @TheFrankmanMN @DraganOrlich @Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes And he's now starting on the tired old "shill" crap.

He's clearly not aware of how gullible he is.
===
@Truckdriverkw @mcfunny @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes That's called "deflection" and it does not for a second alleviate your obligation to provide *evidence* rather than cheap shots and anecdotes.
===
@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes For anyone, including a Holocaust survivor, to claim vaccination programs aimed at preventing the deaths of literally millions of people are as bad as the Holocaust, is an outrageous &amp; disgusting travesty which *demeans* all Holocaust survivors' experience. Was she paid to speak?
===
@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes That is a list of just some of the anti-vax crowd's vested interests. They knock vaccines, but of course they have "alternatives" to sell. Scientists &amp; medicos who aren't employed by Pharma, do *not* have conflicts of interest re vaccines, only the welfare of patients in mind.

@mcfunny @Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Definitely he has no idea of "sampling"!

@DraganOrlich @Truckdriverkw @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Indeed, and the cowards depend on it.
===
@DraganOrlich @Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Like what websites?

@Truckdriverkw @mcfunny @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes If only you knew what you were talking about. You really have no idea.
===
@Truckdriverkw @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @DraganOrlich @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Whereas you who does not bother checking your information for "facts", would likely be slain by a bullet you didn't believe could hurt you because "someone" said bullets were harmless.
===
@mcfunny @Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes And straight out of the anti-vaxers' handbooks that he reckons he hasn't read.

===
@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes I'm sure Pharma along the way have tried to influence all and sundry. But the point you keep *missing* is that health professionals act on *evidence* and the evidence *for* vaccines lies in literally thousands of properly conducted studies, uncontaminated by Pharma.
===
@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes So the "prevention is better than cure" thing doesn't work for you?
===
@DraganOrlich @Truckdriverkw @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes I do hope that was not the case.
===
@DraganOrlich @Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes He has no rational argument because he doesn't have any factual information under his belt. Ad hom is all he has.
===
@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes "You lot" now comprise millions of people. You're not special, and your ability to assess risk is minimal.

@RealEarthParty A speaker questioning the narrative is violently assaulted by someone who apparently disagrees with him.

Freedom of speech? 
Assault charges? 
Hate crime?
Is this how we deal with dissenting points of view in our society?

@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes 2.7 million covid deaths. Between 10-30% long covid. Pretty easy to compare the numbers.
===
@Truckdriverkw @mcfunny @VeritasEver @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Yup and they r called vaccines cuz the virus letting us know it aint going nowhere without an intervention
===
@Truckdriverkw @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @VeritasEver @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Yeah. Hez on the winning side
===
@VeritasEver @Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Theres going to b a lot of unneeded suffering unfortunately. I wonder if eventually the vax will b a requirement bc of all the "experts" that think they dont need to get it....
===
@Truckdriverkw @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @VeritasEver @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Just curious what data or health experts r influencing u?
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes I was on the early treatment kick for a while but vaccines r indicating they block transmission which will help to stop the pandemic by choking the infection lines of the virus.  Early treatment doesnt stop transmission due to pauci infectious spread
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Even holocaust survivors can develop dementia.
===
@VeritasEver @Truckdriverkw @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Anti vax benfitting from all the vaccinated protection around them.
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Sorry but thats not what happens with bad vaccines. They would know the negative affects from phase 3 trials. Thats why astrazeneca is back in the game. Cuz ur AZ death stats arent statistically significant. Its bologna
===
@VeritasEver @Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Next he will start calling us sheep......seems like theres some underlying mental health issues there
===
@mcfunny @Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Add it to the list
===
@Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Theres no early treatment
===
@VeritasEver @Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Hey im going to ignore big numbers and hit u with critiques of non statistically significant small numbers from bunk websites and act like its a conspiracy........
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Im a shill for public health
===
@Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Among other things.........
===
@Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Already got it homie. So did pretty much all my co workers at the hospital. No issues. No cases. Keep pretending G. U dug the hole already. Aint no escaping it now that u being proven wrong. Pride b4 the fall!
===
@Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes False. Its a highly infectious disease that spreads via aerosals. Its not to each their own. There will b no normal until we suppress this pathogen. Same as smallpox, measles, polio, etc.
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes R u going to tie golf into the pandemic too?
===
@Truckdriverkw @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Nah. Just start looking at the vaccine data
===
@mcfunny @SkepticalMutant @Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes From the article,
"So far, state health officials have interviewed 72 of the 89 patients and found that 30 had COVID-19 symptoms. None of the breakthrough cases have led to death, and the patients tended to have mild illnesses".

A
===
@TheFrankmanMN @mcfunny @SkepticalMutant @Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes I just cant believe jenson what a dink. He should b educating pple on the importance of getting a vax. These idiots want normal but dont want pple to get a vaccine. Have they missed the events of the last year? Their own party member died of covid. Wtf
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes U brought a holocaust survivor into a discussion about a public health disaster to justify ur lack of understanding the clear data. Get real.
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes Not as much as u could. Ive reviewed the data
===
@mcfunny @SkepticalMutant @Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes None died, a number with no symptoms. Mostly in an older cohort as they r predominantly the ones vaccinated
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes False. It was a legimate concern and i hope she wasnt exploited
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @SkepticalMutant @mcfunny @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes Imagine if u relatives thought the way u did concerning the polio vaccine. Thank god they were sensible
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @DraganOrlich @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes The angle is just fkg stupid in a grand scale. Its funny you fall for the anti-vax grift. https://t.co/ZXM8PiCus5

@Truckdriverkw @DraganOrlich @VeritasEver @TheFrankmanMN @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes posting that demonstrates you ahve no idea about these types of investigations...
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes um, you do know what 95% effectiveness means, right? I mean this is well known to happen....
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes 89 people with covid out of 800,000 vaccinated...
https://t.co/fY2O7J87xX
===
@Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @SkepticalMutant @kcIMT122 @TheFrankmanMN @BadCOVID19Takes the effectiveness of the vaccine was always reported to be 95%....not 100%...the goal posts haven't moved. you appear to misunderstand this topic.

===
@DraganOrlich @mcfunny @SkepticalMutant @Truckdriverkw @VeritasEver @MsTrixter @kcIMT122 @BadCOVID19Takes From what I understand, most of these were discovered upon routine testing required of residents in care facilities.

If this isn't testament to wider-spread use of this vaccine, I don't know what is.

@1onlybillyshea1 @cxpage @ianfmusgrave @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Show me a map of the flat earth. The ones you read and trust with directions are made consistent with Earth being shaped like a sphere. Like I said: a massive self-own.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 That‚Äôs literally the map above. If the earth were flat the map would look much different. Not my problem you don‚Äôt understand how to read or use a map.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 Pick two points on the map. Then drive from point A to point B there, zeroing your odometer prior to starting. Was the distance consistent with the distance represented on the map? sounds like a good experiment.
===
@1onlybillyshea1 @ianfmusgrave @cxpage @rtiggerm @provaxtexan @dr_zenitram @SimonTe53732612 What's in the lower left-hand corner? If this map doesn't represent reality, then distances between any two points would not be consistent with reality. Ever wonder why not a single flat earth map contains a scale?
