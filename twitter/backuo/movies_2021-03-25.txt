unflop 

drop a genre and i‚Äôll recommend a good movie/ show! (only if i know the genre well enough)
===
@mamixchann Enchantress from suicide squad. Pretty good movie of your into that genre!
===
that said the movie‚Äôs a classic for a reason, namely that there‚Äôs a lot of technical prowess &amp; showmanship involved, &amp; that also means that a Lot of the content is extremely dated, which is unfortunate for a film so omnipresent in the genre now
===
@GarfieldFan_69 @washingtonpost The comic book movie genre has more potential than being just "fun" or "escapism", that's the point
===
@_thisisvenom @bellnjerry @THR I can't believe that fans of any genre property still use the IMDB audience scores (especially during any property's debut week) as "proof" of popularity. LOL Fandoms always flood IMDB with praise to artificially enhance good scores. üòÅü§£ü§£

this is my favorite movie genre so I have a lot lmao

sleepover, 13 going on 30, sydney white, the hot chick, john tucker must die, the house bunny, what a girl wants, the princess diaries movies, aquamarine, she‚Äôs all that, bend it like beckham, ella enchanted, and easy A https://t.co/rbgq3c5vPz

I consider myself to be a movie buff, and I love watching all kinds of movies, from Oscar worthy ones to silly ones made by Rob Schneider. 

Right now, I am fed up with crime genre, I just want to watch a movie that is similar to the Notebook, I just love that movie. https://t.co/ruaPS07CCT

@KEEMSTAR Think about it Keem. Comedy as a movie genre is pretty dead, BUT it's a common sub-genre of other movies. People expect Spider-Man or Ant Man to have jokes and be witty/funny. Action movies in general go for that balance of action, drama, comedy evenly nowadays.
===
The last four movies I have logged on Letterboxd I find funny. It‚Äôs 3 classics considered to be some of the greatest of their genre. Then the Ben 10 finale movie. I‚Äôm a man of taste what can I say! https://t.co/5ybunky7QB

@jasonkilar @hbomax With all due respect sir, when we say #RestoreTheSnyderVerse  we want to restore creativity and bring cinema back in superhero genre. We wish to restore a person's hard work who planned atleast 10 years ahead while sticking to the rich folklore of DC.

I have absolutely IDOLIZED the Muppets for as long as I can remember and this is a result of that. Jim Henson is more genius than I ever grave him credit for because here I am, a perfectly trained actor for a very niche movie genre. Incredible. This is a big moment for me. (2/2)

@bapIuv literally though... as much as i appreciate saw and what it did for the genre it resulted in a lot of directors thinking gore was an easy ticket to a 'good' horror movie

Like, this movie is legendary even in the "car movie" genre. It debuted the new Dodge Challenger, revolutionized car films along with 2 Lane Blacktop, and was so influential decades later that Audioslave did an entire video echoing the movie.

@theonlyJaReW @Brian_D_PB @vintage_katie_ When I watched Rogue One, I thought for a genre movie it was incompetently made. (They were better at it in the 40s-60s.)

@StillFizz Defending, yes, because you're detracting from a harsh assessment.

This movie imo  overrated , filled with stupid decisions , characters acting out of  nature , and although its a classic  movie , i think it doesnt live up to today's standarts for the zombie survival genre , also the ending was inconclusive and unnecessary grim imo 6/10

@shawnporter23 I do like they're continuing their history of allowing each show/movie to be its own thing both in genre and in theme.

I hope Loki is totally off-the-wall.

I think they could take it as far as Legion went - but they never will on the platform (which is a bit of a shame).

I love critiquing movies (obviously), but rating them is such a struggle.There isn‚Äôt just one universal rating scale. Like I could watch a movie that may be a solid 3 stars but compared to another 3 star film, it doesn‚Äôt hold up. I guess it‚Äôs maybe a genre divide, but not really

"Sam Peckinpah would never be mistaken for a romantic, but this offering from the gritty director features off-the-charts sexual tension between #SteveMcQueen and Ali McGraw that mirrored their off-screen affair."

I dunno if I can vote for either of these 2.... 
Both are iconic, w/PM being a lot of ppl's first exposure to Miyazaki, while Akira is genre-defining &amp; shows the West the true potential of the animated medium beyond "Kid's movie." It's also quintessentially Japanese, like GiTS https://t.co/xa1mZfUS9R

@Mr_Ambition14 I won‚Äôt say he‚Äôs a great director, but he was in a tough position. Warner Bros wanted an Avengers type universe in 3 movies to cash in on the super hero genre. I‚Äôd say what we got in ZS‚Äôs Justice League was the best WB could ask for.

@TCMaz1980 Personally I think that this movie is underrated - and "no one" likes it because everyone was butt hurt when they found out it wasn't real. It pioneered a whole new genre in horror. I still like to watch this movie, have good memories with friendsüôÇ
===
@yaoilynnx1 I think 90-95% of the actors you see in bls are straight men looking to use the popularity of the genre as a stepping stone to other things and know what's involved. I suspect few of them have actual passion for it. And that's fine as long as the actor gives it his all idgaf.
===
@liftoffboom Oh Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band. Sooo good. Listening to Fire Lake now thanks to you. I should probably start a rock account. Oh and a movie one. But it might be too much work. I've noticed the 3 don't go well together unless they're all the same genre.

@bizmarkiedesade it kept trying to play songs from the live action lion king movie for me awhile back, in the midst of a bunch of indie rock/electronic or rap. i‚Äôm pretty sure a label can just pay to slip an album into a playlist regardless of genre or previous listening.

@BondHunterBond I either make a playlist of really big, dramatic songs, or I listen to Coconut Mall from Mariokart on loop. if neither of those work, I pick a random movie on Netflix of the genre I'm trying to write in, and pick the movie apart to see what I liked and what I didn't.

@aptshadow @BadWilf That's definitely PART of it -- it feels like a weird genre shift -- but at least for me that's not the main reason I don't like the movie.  It has a cartoony-ness to the action (maybe CGI overuse?) that makes it feel like a parody rather than a sequel.

rating based on my fav writing-genre: 
1. content writing: 11//10 really fun for creativity and knowledge.
2. fiction: especially if you listen to a song or watch a movie, you'll definitely get inspiration for your imagination and creativity.
3. scientific papers: logic only:)

Poetry will teach you word placement

Radio and music will teach you sound

Screenplay - visuals

Theatre - moving characters and space

Shorts - editing

Novels - expanding worlds and character 

I could go on about intersection of genre but we'll be here forever

@duck_paints @zmrfzn @sonsofMMA @ZackSnyder @Lesdoggg Not really. It is a comic book movie. The comic book movie genre has more fans than regular movies do.

@MoviesSilently Was this ‚ÄùThe kiss in the tunnel‚Äù or was that a different movie? There is  one in the early genre of having a camera in front of the train engine and then someone invented editing when the train went into a tunnel - a stolen kiss. Audience was mind blown. (Film school memory.)
