@brittney_beck @TonyRchrdsn I wish you could have seen his face while opening his “gifts” like a bandaid, dipping sauces and other random items. Priceless! Almost as good as his face when he walked in and told us 73 times it wasn’t his birthday. 😂

@poci82 I wish Bethesda would look at the underused weapons in the game &amp; create interest in them. Like have 1 random weapon/weekend that reverts to multiplicative damage for the period. It would get players to try weapons they usually ignore. Walking sticks! Blunderbusses! Gamma guns!

So today I have some commitments so I wont be streaming today and weekends will be random. Wish u all a great day!
===
@sarkasaa I DO wish there were kits available to buy, without having to risk it with random Ali sellers...

Also, those things are designed for ABS parts, and I'm not equipped to print that... :/

These new(ish) Twitter Topics are a massive pain in the arse. The more I register my disinterest in suggested Topics the more random the subsequent Topic suggestions become. I wish there was a way to just turn the bloody things off.

@emrazz @solesurfer1 Unfortunately, she still has to interact with pawns of the patriarchy, whether it's a coworker, friend, sibling, family member, random stranger, etc. And doubly unfortunate, women can reinforce the patriarchy as well as men, as much as I wish neither did.

Leffen and other people with a platform supported the victims who bravely spoke out about Zer0 and other toxic people in the community and I will always respect them for it. Going after them for what Zer0 is going through is the dumbest shit. Also don't wish ppl dead. Idiotic..

@NothileMajola Isizathu sami sokusho njalo is that when “everybody” starts having your contact, they’ll feel way too comfortable to contact you about the random things but when it’s emails, bazonqena most of the time. One thing I wish I had done back then was to set up boundaries 🤞🏾

I wish #Warzone had constantly changing gun stats 😔 Would be dope to have a “dynamic boost” system where random guns no one uses (Scar, Milano, KSP45) receive stat boosts that make them the “gun of the week” for a given week. Could cycle all guns and encourage grinding in MP.

I figured out that I can’t wish myself a very happy die for a few hours so here’s a random #sabigiyuu thread instead 

“I can’t believe that you did that!”

I have never really heard a lot of Pastors teach on so called name it and claim it. I presume people attack it as as desire to just make a random wish and presume God will do it? I believe the Biblical basis for this phrase would be that we speak the will of God from the Bible...

Yeah I don't think that's dream and the namemc stuff is lol worthy as "evidence". Kind of wish this trend of trying to cancel content creators either by digging up random stuff in their past or by fabricating evidence would end already, kinda lame tbh.
