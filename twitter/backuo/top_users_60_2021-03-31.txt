@alcego_writes oh dear
===
@not_yibo oh i totally feel that! for me hrt is more of a way of like,, connecting w/my body but that's definitely not the defining feature of being trans!! ur so incredibly valid
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite it’s like, ig the way i’d say it is ur not Craving ur QPR in the same way as u crave a romantic partner (no desire for like. kissing &amp; such, even if u do want physical intimacy ie cuddling/hugs). it’s still intense, but in a different direction, if that makes sense?
===
lrt the vibes i'm getting for an old guard au ft. the iron maidens is unreal rn
===
IN MY DEFENSE, THIS IS MY FIRST YEAR IN A VERY INVOLVED MAJOR AND I'VE LEGIT ALMOST DIED ONCE AND HAVE BEEN SEVERELY INJURED ONCE SO IF THE TREND CONTINUES—
===
hey when i graduate in approximately 4 years what do we think about "i lived bitch" on the grad cap?
===
they had to kill mario today otherwise the news would be trapped under april fools maritime law, where nothing counts, and mario's death would never be verifiable
===
anyway thinking about the saga of jin ling and the chinese finger trap &amp; the wildly different ways it ends with and without jiang yanli there to stop jiang cheng from solving the trick for him
===
thinking abt bottomji getting fucked by wwx &amp; having serious Feelings abt how wwx lays himself across lwj’s back, mindless of his scars—or perhaps bc of them, covering him now bc he couldn’t then
===
@trixietricoter 🥺🥺🥺 thank you Deb!!! i'm sure i'll feel fine about it once i've graduated (or even when i'm in more upper-level classes) it just feels weird to be in classes with 18 year olds 😅
===
pigeon’s legit babying me bc she was worried that i didn’t get out of bed today lol
===
this took me a while to understand (with he/him lesbians acting as the catalyst; i simply do not have the life experience to fully understand the IDs, but i can respect their decision to use these labels. i listened a LOT &amp; did my own digging &amp; developed a better understanding—
===
oh no now i'm thinking about how i'll graduate with my bachelors when i'm 24 going on 25 (if all goes well) and even though ik i have a good reason (read: paid for my own education, working constantly, exploring majors before landing on what i wanted, etc) it feels bad man
===
@GenderGriffins exactly!!!! it takes so much less energy to be like “cool! glad that works for u” and move on with ur day 😂
===
@trixietricoter hap birth!!!!!!!!!
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite in my XP it’s in a similar vein to romantic r-ships (w/the things mentioned above involved) but lacks the romantic feelings. the name came abt bc it was coined (iirc) by aro ppl looking for ways to label their committed, unromantic r-ships. 1/3
===
fuck!! i need that week!!!! i need a break so i can recalibrate but i feel like i’ve been set on fire and shoved off a plane and i’m so fucking mad at myself bc i can’t even finish simple tasks that are supposed to be fun and i HATE it
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite QPR reinforces the idea that ace &amp; aro ppl r inherently queer, and as such all of their r-ships r also queer, even when they’re platonic rather than romantic. &amp; while u can certainly think of QPRs as being “intense friendships” i feel like doing that overlooks the nature of QPRs
===
i did wind up sleeping all day today which i feel awful abt but i think i really needed it
===
another day of me grabbing my breakfast and forgetting to eat it until lunch has already opened
===
wow i can't believe we know the exact date and time of mario's death
===
@womb2tombs losing my shit ur 100% correct
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite oh yeah i totally understand!! i just have difficulty IDing &amp; expressing my own emotions so that’s really where my ability to help ends 😅 realizing that period at the end makes my tone seem a lot sharper lol
===
@trixietricoter yeah!!! like hooo boy am i out of my depth with these children 😩
===
yet again i've remembered the existence of ftm gender confirmation surgery &amp; thinking about the way they handle the "issue" of erections is both ingenious and will never fail to make me want to laugh hysterically
===
@WUJlBOT tbh it could go either way depending on exactly how uhhhhh ornery wwx’s feeling when we meet but i already got the quiet thing down &amp; enjoy absorbing energy off people lol
===
nearly shit myself because IT KEPT TALKING TO ME so i texted them like "hey uhhhh whatthe fuck is this" and they were like "oh i just have that so i don't lose track of time" LIKE BRO??? U JUST LET UR LAPTOP YELL "IT'S 1AM" AT U LIKE IT'S CHILL???????
===
@not_yibo yeAh like i genuinely just.... forget that technically that’s a label that applies to me lmao
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that’s pretty much what goes down w/QPRs as well, but the driving feelings &amp; methodology for intensifying the r-ship will likely be different. it’s hard to verbalize the differences bc these r very closely related emotions
===
lrt i can't tell if it's funnier if this is pre-slowburn sangcheng w/nhs being Kind Of An Ass &amp; jc is just like. "neat." and moves on bc [REDACTED FOR ANGST REASONS] &amp; then next semester they wind up being lab partners and jc is just WAITING for nhs to suggest a study sesh,,,
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that’s fine! i’m just trying to explain why QPR isn’t just a “silly queer” way of referring to friendships, and i’ve done my best to explain my understanding of the emotional differences, but i really can’t offer anything else on the matter.
===
oh my fucking god i forgot the name of chinese finger traps and i spent like thirty minutes searching "paper knot finger tube" i hate it here 😭
===
@Vorvayne @felethos honestly same!! if i do end up getting a more uhh updated macbook i'll probably be using that feature a Whole Bunch so that time stops not existing
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that’s fine! i’m just trying to explain why QPR isn’t just a “silly queer” way of referring to friendships, and i’ve done my best to explain my understanding of the emotional differences, but i really can’t offer anything else on the matter.
===
like "yeah hold on one sec  i just gotta. Get My Rod Aligned Real Quick" and for once i'm not using rod as a euphemism for dick
===
@headBONDmeLWJ oooo i wonder how they'd look if they were like. framed  and put on the wall or smth—they're so pretty!!!
===
still thinking abt the time someone told me i have the same energy as this vine https://t.co/LxMqhpmmmD
===
like. for reference, adderall gives my brain the tiny little jolt it needs to stop zoning out/flitting from vague idea to vague idea and helps me moderate my energy &amp; mood but the ritalin does literally NOTHING for me, like?? my brain is mud
===
i forgot what the other option in this scenario was. i got possessed by lab partners sangcheng
===
@GenderGriffins exactly!! i get very defensive of QPRs specifically bc they’re the subject of so much ridicule &amp; it’s like… u do realize that’s someone’s life, right?
===
wow there's really no part of this new dn that's not wildly cursed is there
===
for totally normal not-petty reasons except this Is nhs we're talking about so that never happens and jc finally snaps like "are we getting coffee or what?" and nhs is like "😳 how very forward of u yes let's" and jc's like "??? we have a report due?? how is any of this forward?"
===
i love y'all and i'm begging u if ur a trans w/dysphoria about lack of dick plz look into either dick prosthetics or phalloplasty (which is exactly what it sounds like) bc i legit cried when i realized that was a thing that i could get done
===
i only know the mdzs characters but i've absorbed enough through osmosis that i get the general vibe and i'm LOSING it over how one sided some of these are https://t.co/ucOEUHYcAI
===
oh right i need to submit another maintenance request since it takes my tub approx. 1.5 hours to drain most of the way and approximately 5 minutes to fill all the way up
===
oh my god my friend let me try out their newer macbook so i could get a feel for it before i commit to buying one (the one i got for $300 is, uh, severely wanting despite being functional LMAO) and i keep fucking forgetting about the little touch bar where i USUALLY REST MY HANDS
===
@zeesongxiao np!! i think a lot of ppl get confused by QPRs bc it’s very much a nonstandard way to commit urself to another person, so i try to offer my small bit of insight when i can ☺️
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite (namely that they’re more involved/committed than “friendship” suggests). think abt friends getting married for those sick benefits &amp; being totally chill abt it w/no desire or expectation for romantic growth &amp; ur on the right track for what QPRs are 3/3
===
i only have the ritalin bc, check this: my doc switched me to adderall when it Obviously wasn't working (it's not a build'em'up drug like antidepressants, so when i saw no change after a week i was like "uhhh  hey: no" and we went to adderall instead &amp; that did the trick)
===
also :) the verbage here is intentional :) don't worry about it :)
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite lol tbh i feel like a lot of ppl never really feel the need to distinguish btwn these sorts of emotions (since most ppl focus on intensifying their romantic rships rather than their platonic ones)
===
—but at no point during that process would it have been ok to make fun of he/him lesbians. also: it’s primarily used by butch lesbians whose rship w/gender is very complex, &amp; no! the labels do not conflict in any way &lt;3)
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite aha yeah, i totally get that! unfortunately i’m not especially great at identifying or expressing my own emotions, which makes explaining it kind of difficult lol
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite i think it’s the active decision to commit to a r-ship with the understanding that there will be different social expectations than with a friendship that marks the difference honestly.
===
this just in: i'm very trans, not as femme aligned as most ppl think (transitioning is a slow process, especially in the south), and lowkey looking forward to second puberty
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite mmm that’s definitely harder to nail down, bc Emotions, but think abt how ur feelings toward ur family (assuming a pos. r-ship) differ from those for a romantic partner; they’re no less intense, can still be described as love, &amp; involve a lot of committment
===
me: identifies with they/them pronouns

me: looking into HRT &amp; surgery

me: gets extremely uncomfortable when ppl who Know continue to use the wrong name/pronouns

also me: oh no haha i'm not Actually trans, don't be silly
===
@vivipgri !!! what a fluffy baby!
===
@whenasinsilks @_astrophyllite @wayofcloudbrain oh i didn’t know that!! i think the ppl i’ve spoken to abt this in the past were both aro and ace, so i always assumed the lack of sexual attraction part of it 😅 thanks for sharing!!
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite totally valid!!! &amp; yeah i’d say there’s a distinction, but (for me) it’s pretty hard to explain it exactly lol
===
anyway my sudden uhhhh swing into Hell Mood makes me think that the adderall may have a more significant impact on my depression than previously thought (ig i just need that sweet sweet dopamine??)
===
@laazulink theyre so CUTE omg 🥺🥺
===
and long story short jc doesn't realize they're literally dating until the next semester when nhs is like "icb u broke up w/me via ghosting" and jc's like "WHEN WERE WE EVEN DATING" and they both Realize™
===
i swear my eyesight’s significantly getting worse by the week
===
@wayofcloudbrain @Vorvayne @felethos one day,,, one day we'll get the option for randomized voicing options on these things to get around adhd brain's bullheaded determination to tune Everything out
===
also there's always the chance i'll get another kidney infection or, god forbid, the ovarian cyst they identified while looking at my kidneys will do Something &amp; tbqh the odds are not leaning in my favor
===
i have been taking. the Fastest showers
===
@womb2tombs NO 😱 just thinking abt that Hurts me holy shit
===
vagueing but make it pos.: asked one of my friends for feedback on a short story the other day and got back some incredibly helpful and frankly really really constructive insights &amp; anyway i love my friends so much
===
ok i have to get to work but here’s a word of advice: it doesn’t matter if you understand a term ppl use to label themselves. that does not make it invalid or ok to joke abt. it just means YOU lack the life experiences needed to form a full understanding of the term.
===
LRT caleb does this and he's so mad that my shower's having drainage issues bc now he can't sit in the tub after i shower and GLORP
===
anyway i’m having a bad brain day so if anyone has some kind words/pics/memes to share that’d be rad (can be related to anything so long as they’re soft) 🧡 love y’all
===
@westiectweets yo holy shit i don't have the Time to read this threadfic yet but @Zizzani UR REALLY JUST OUT THERE DROPPING BANGERS, HUH?
===
calc1 really isn't that hard but i'm finding that profs have a tendency to explain things in the most convoluted way possible
===
@dahliaderouge @wwxprime hello 😳😳 love the dragon dick
===
like idk why but putting derivatives in terms of d/dx is Very very hard for my brain to process but if u explain product rule in terms of the prime of a function suddenly i understand (e.g. "f'(x)(g(x))+g'(x)(f(x))" makes more sense to my brain than the same thing written w/d/dx)
===
why the fuck am i having emotions. i haven’t done anything today like? literally this is my own fault and yet!!
===
had some issues with my pharmacy so i've been diving into my old ritalin and BOY HOWDY this one does NOT do it for me LMAO
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite like u can want to snuggle with family &amp; not want to wife em up, yknow? it’s just a different way of including an important person in ur life
===
i was just Exhausted but she’s taking her job as an ESA very seriously which is definitely a good thing
===
whenever i think abt jiang chemg i wind up thinking abt that bpd book “i hate you don’t leave me” which i think says a lot
===
@felethos honestly i'm just mad i didn't think of it first
===
wait wtf i almost forgot i'm trans
===
@weiwuxiansnose i'm so sorry sugar, take care of yourself 🧡🧡🧡
===
why the fuck does my friend have their laptop set to read the hour on the hour in chinese
===
i just need a week to stop existing but due to covid my uni decided spring break would be one (1) friday and i was running a show that weekend so it doesn’t even count like—
===
@laazulink thank u for ur service &amp; to cat for blessing us with this gem
===
@lillith78x aha thanks! &amp; tbh it should be fine &amp; if it's not there's really not much they can do about it at that point lol
===
it can be tempting to react w/ridicule to new terms that are used by minority groups bc they “seem silly” or whatever, but like… if they’re using the term, it’s for a reason. don’t be another person who—intentionally or otherwise—invalidates other marginalized groups.

@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite this convo is certainly making me feel like i've maybe been missing something big and didn't even know it
story of my life lol
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite or to invalidate their experiences! if anything i'm probably the alien, i'm just trying to figure out in what precise way, if that makes sense
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite and i'm not disputing that at all!
it's more like i'm trying to figure out why i'm having such a hard time wrapping my head around these distinctions. it all bleeds together in my head/heart. so this is really not an attempt to alienate anyone who feels this distinction
===
@Vorvayne @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite (i was sure i have been in love but who knows! i've certainly had my heart broken by *friends*, and intense, anxious friend crushes have been a thing.
i've thought that perhaps the only thing that slots my relationship into different categories is the way people respond to me.)
===
@Vorvayne @alcego_writes @felethos i'm doing this right away
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that dimension removed, i'm having a very hard time pinpointing the difference to a "merely" platonic relationship if it's *not* intensity or commitment (which it presumably isn't if there is a separate category for platonic + intense + committed)
===
@alcego_writes @Vorvayne @felethos i wish i could tell my clock to do a different language/voice on every hour but sadly such madness seems not to be supported 😅
===
@Vorvayne @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite huh, funny. cloudy is learning something here haha. i'll go and quiz everyone i know about what they think romance feels like.
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite well, i'd say, for a while the difference is in a conscious wish to intensify the depth of the relationship, and gain that level of commitment; then, once achieved, its actually very much akin to familial love.
(there's also the element of sex, but i'm keeping that out of it.)
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite ok interesting! i think i have just discovered my main problem which is that i apparently do not really understand what makes a relationship romantic. (i thought it was the wish for commitment and for playing a somewhat more exclusive role in someone's life)
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite i feel like the issue for defining what makes a relationship "romantic" is seriously hindered by the sexual dimension that is conventionally expected to be a part of it.

===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite But if someone sticks around long enough a bit of my brain goes, okay, you are Family now, and there's a pretty big distinction because then their presence is relevant to like my Life Decisions.

I realise this is probably what ace dating looks like, but in that case,
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Ikr

It does feel to me like the monogamous expectation is, you're not allowed to be as close to anyone else as you are to me, whether or not you sleep with them, which. I - I'm not managing my relationships that way, sorry not sorry. Sexual monogamy is fine, but this shit? 😬
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Like there's people who are your bros, kindof - you might be close or not, but primarily they're a chill hang, and you're not super involved in each other's lives. Then there's a sortof intermediate thing of being close friends, but that can be temporary, like romo relationships.
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes Except for the sex thing. I mean, basically every time I've gone in the direction of sex with a close friend it's ended up as a relationship, which seems perfectly normal to me, like, isn't that?? What a relationship IS?? Isn't that what a crush is, when you really like someone
===
@alcego_writes @felethos I was gonna say, this is a GREAT idea like it'd piss me off probably but it'd do my ADHD ass a world of good
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Oh yeah, like, being arospec I basically just assume that there IS a thing other people are experiencing and describing and like, good for them!!!

Honestly I like the word queerplatonic bc it could be a way of describing those friends-who-are-family relationships.
===
@StoicMoonbeam @windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Sending good thoughts (I don't really have spoons either I just can't focus on work 😭)

Ah, another way in which I'm an anarchist. How fun!
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I'm with cloudteeth - I don't really Get a difference between romantic &amp; familial feelings if you remove sex for a moment, but I like to just let that be there for the people who do. Like, I'm arospec, so.

What I absolutely do experience is a difference between Family + Friends.
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite RELATABLE

Oof

The only things I appear to actually need are "some close supportive friends" and "semi regular hugs" and "to do something about the sex drive (which does not require additional participants)".
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I'm confused about the expectation that one should have only one "not actually related but definitely Family" person? Like...either I'm WILDLY romantically polyamorous, which seems unlikely, or I just don't experience a difference between platonic and romantic. So. Yeah!
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes Extremely loud nodding along over here, yeah. All of my relationships have been me just getting to know someone on the normal way and then, oh huh we're in a relationship now apparently. That's nice. I will behave absolutely no differently than I would if we were close friends.
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Once the cishets brought up the idea of "emotional affairs" and I was fully like, what the fuck are you guys ON.

I just tell people I'm polyamorous these days: it isn't entirely accurate but it does helpfully manage their expectations.
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes As a potential friend and you wanna get to know them but also you think they're hot??

I hear the answer to this is No and I am *baffled* but nod along with interest at how different other people are.
===
@wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite This confusion is basically how I determined I'm arospec. Not that it really matters, since I'm not ace and am open to relationships; I just don't seem to feel like non-sexual intimacy and commitment has two separate ways of being. Romantic friends assure me they do.
===
@wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I've loved people deeply and intensely, and it took a friend breakup to realise the relationship tag was not required for me to feel devastated by a breakup.

@ChaoticGoodInn Keeping them in the package seems joyless, unless you're planning to just keep them until they're worth more and sell.
===
@ChaoticGoodInn ur just mad i completely wrecked ur no u today
===
@ChaoticGoodInn Mfs underestimating your power
===
@ChaoticGoodInn and then if u dont u feel guilty for not streaming,,,
===
@ChaoticGoodInn i love you. men have been extra shit today :(
===
@dahliaderouge @alcego_writes t-two pp 🥵😳😳🥵
===
@ChaoticGoodInn You're like the least toxic person I've met????? What???????
===
@ChaoticGoodInn I’ve never understood the whole “keep it in the box” thing, even for collectors. Like, if the box is kept in good condition for when you want to possibly sell it later who cares if it’s been opened?
===
@ChaoticGoodInn never!!!! https://t.co/H1UsIQO1VS
===
@ChaoticGoodInn e-them? E-dragon? 🤔😂
===
@ChaoticGoodInn you're about as toxic as water 😂
===
@ChaoticGoodInn me to whoever callin you toxic https://t.co/aOQjKnrAcp
===
@ChaoticGoodInn As always I’m actually middle

Depends on the intent of purchase. If you want a decoration, out of box

If you investing hoping they the next beanie baby, in the box
===
@ChaoticGoodInn I see you :) https://t.co/9DzQ8GXFQz
===
@ChaoticGoodInn @A_TypicalQueer You forgot to bring outbthe hammer Chuck https://t.co/LczxP0WhSE

@ChaoticGoodInn Omg 🥺💕🥺 I found these at target the other day! I’m obsessed with overalls.

@ChaoticGoodInn Me squinting through the plastic and past the excess bullshit on the outside to try and see the highly detailed pop figure inside https://t.co/IH7uYlSVjg
===
@sams_takeover @ChaoticGoodInn I wonder if the long hair is holding you back?? I twist mine a lot which is easier bc of the length
===
@NieniesRevenge @ChaoticGoodInn girl how do your space buns look better than any i’ve ever made in my whole life?? 😫🖤😫   &amp; ive got long ass hair too!!
===
@ChaoticGoodInn Who, ME?! https://t.co/bRJWyWi5cT
===
@ChaoticGoodInn I'm gonna miss it when I go back to my natural color. 😩
===
@ChaoticGoodInn CHUCK!!! Why you so noice to me? 😭

@AtikinGames @ProjectKYLA @lupus_games @dinasaidso @howlingmoongame @Eric_P_Henn @Imetadream1 @LGNOEpodcast @thegiantbrain @TTInquisition We had a 3-year anniversary this week! :)
https://t.co/is0UdcOWvH

Wiki started off with a vid https://t.co/pO6NDgKQTr
which on one hand is still valid:  go deep into games and music, see new things, but it also shows how much got developed during this time. 

We still gather! :)
===
@LGNOEpodcast OOOOO thank you! I'll have to have a gander 👀
===
@chmpgneprbIm THE HEADER
===
@chmpgneprbIm WHAT
===
@AtikinGames @ProjectKYLA @gamesformusic @lupus_games @dinasaidso @howlingmoongame @Eric_P_Henn @Imetadream1 @LGNOEpodcast @TTInquisition Recording our 70th episode and our 3rd year anniversary show this Friday. Hoping to answer some listener questions on the show or from any posed here. Anything you have ever wanted to ask some podcasters?
===
@ChaoticGoodInn Personally the box would take up to much space for me, not to mention I'm tight on space as it is. Out of box for me 😁
===
@ChaoticGoodInn I'm on the fence about those. Yes your space your things, display them how you like. At the same time that's so much space you might want for something else later, then what do you do?
===
@AtikinGames @ProjectKYLA @gamesformusic @lupus_games @dinasaidso @howlingmoongame @Eric_P_Henn @Imetadream1 @LGNOEpodcast @thegiantbrain @TTInquisition Finishing up the draft for a pair of posts for my blog, photos included, plus a playtest and an ongoing transaltion, searching for additional boardgame-related work, and, as always, lots of ideas bubbling around :)
===
@chmpgneprbIm It’s definitely her most vulnerable and that alone is saying a lot
===
@chmpgneprbIm I WAS GOING TO SEND IT TO YOU
===
@chmpgneprbIm @dykesforharry doesn’t change the fact that he still doesn’t
===
@chmpgneprbIm @dykesforharry k but he still doesn’t 😋
===
@Vorvayne @windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I wish I had the spoons to participate to this conversation because so much “Saaamee” for what you all just said. 
And I personally use “relationship anarchist” as label to express the above concepts + I explain I tend to commit intensely to the people in my inner monkeysphere.
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite (which is tbh how my whole system works: I describe myself as poly, aro, and ace, because you cannot expect monogamy, romance, or sex from me reliably because I may be capable of them but I don't know where the levers are, and I definitely don't NEED them)
===
@wayofcloudbrain @Vorvayne @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I can be in relationships but that's very much a "oh we appear to be in a relationship now, cool I guess" and I just cannot grasp the categorisation system or the idea of going looking for a specific category of relationship or what the distinct sorts of feelings are meant to be.
===
@wayofcloudbrain @Vorvayne @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite (I also historically have minor meltdowns at the idea that my relationships are supposed to be *monogamous* because HOW I don't know what I DID to turn this into """a relationship""" HOW DO I KNOW I WON'T DO IT AGAIN BY ACCIDENT?)
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite yeah I say I'm poly because god, all I know about myself is that I'm DEFINITELY NOT MONO.
===
@wayofcloudbrain @Vorvayne @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that confusion is also what made me decide I'm arospec but also why while I'm happy for people who are happy in queerplatonic relationships I do NOT grok what that is supposed to feel like. 

my brain slides off the idea in exactly the same way it slides off "define romance"
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes yeah my problem is that I like kissing and like...sex-adjacent stuff? but not so much actual sex. 

and I move in circles where there's a good deal of friend-kissing (and friend-sexy) stuff so the vague "romance is friends but also kissing?" idea fell right off a cliff there
===
@alcego_writes yeah like what's hard about realizing that something is important to someone else and not being a dick about it? the fact someone doesn't get something doesn't mean it therefore has no value.
===
@alcego_writes i am sorry people were butts &lt;3 the world is gross enough as it is
===
@alcego_writes it takes NO MONEY to be kind to each other. people being jerks are literally going out of their way to do it. compassion is the lazy person's way out, try it!! you'll like it!!! aren't you tired of being on a high horse???
===
@alcego_writes Eti and I were QPR for a bit and I still think that's one of the relationship types that makes my autistic demisexual self absolutely shine. It's frustrating because ppl also make fun of being genderqueer, and neopronouns, and like... it's the same thing ya dingus
===
@alcego_writes Thank you!!
===
@alcego_writes Full disclosure tho maybe wait for the eiselcross arc to end man It's been A Lot gkgjf 🥶
===

@alanbullion2 @angela_funnell @Rusthallred @davefunnell2 Are there clear criteria for justifying and prioritising installation of crossings, given funds are limited? At present, it seems to be who has most influence with Conservative majority on KCC? Good to see a more transparent democratic process. Most roads have older residents!
===
@OllieGulliver @ErikGriffin @SbmmWarzone IMDB owns the API that stores the data on their website. SBMM Warzone does not. It's owned by Activision, and SBMM Warzone is essentially charging for advanced access to data that is not theirs to sell. They should've just monetized their website via donations.
