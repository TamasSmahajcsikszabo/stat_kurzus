@Alex_on_A14 @LongCovidFight @GabrielScally @ONS potentially it is but self assessments isnt medical assessments so therefore cant be determined fully. I am not undermining this at all just wondering why we need medical confirmation that someone has covid but dont when we talk about long covid
===
@LongCovidFight @Alex_on_A14 @GabrielScally @ONS Exactly what you say , medical assessments based on medical evidence instead of self assessments
===
@Alex_on_A14 @LongCovidFight @GabrielScally @ONS this is only again referring back to the self assessment
===
@Alex_on_A14 @GabrielScally @ONS yes i saw that , its a self assessment though not a medical one though. I am presuming that if they were medically examined then those figures could change. Also why cant 12 weeks be deemed recovery?
===
@LongCovidFight @Alex_on_A14 @GabrielScally @ONS As someone who may be aware of it , are there any studies based on medical assessments instead of self assessments ?

@belltowergames @4ChitsNGiggles But the human factor is always there, even for solo games. If a game advertises replayability, it means a large number of variations in gameplay to spice up how the players make decisions. I think it's a worthwhile information, but I understand how for some , it's irrelevant.

A 'v' passport is not an enhancement. If you have a fixed address and a bank account they have the absolute lot already.

@ifbacongrewont1 @JamesMelville I understand. Obviously that's what the 'v' does.

But aside from the clever stuff - we can't find the 'baseline' for prexisting anywhere - it certainly only starts at a PFR of 0.5% - and 3 separate studies on 'acquired (antibodies) are only 80%.

@aaipae Ive checked. Massive understimate.

@mcdon_al @AndrewSherman19 @BarnabyRaine No doubt that’s true, but I’m not sure details of uniform policy are critical. As you guessed earlier, the issues at Pimlico run deeper than that.

@Alex_on_A14 @JamesMelville Forget antibodies - especially with mRNA vaccines (they have no covid in them). T cells -that's what we need to check for, they last longer, years even. Check to see if the T cells are now primed to detect and defeat Covid 19. https://t.co/3PHPZce0iI
===
@Alex_on_A14 @JamesMelville If u want to see if a vaccine works - then give the vaccinated person a shot of real covid. This is how we tested to see if the smallpox vaccine worked - with a shot of real small pox.

@Alex_on_A14 @JamesMelville Forget antibodies - especially with mRNA vaccines (they have no covid in them). T cells -that's what we need to check for, they last longer, years even. Check to see if the T cells are now primed to detect and defeat Covid 19. https://t.co/3PHPZce0iI

@Alex_on_A14 @JamesMelville Yes, lots of reinfections, this is common for many viruses, pathogens etc, including the flu - the issue is does a particular vaccine work or not. This is key for 2 reasons: they can do harm, and they will cost us money personally, eventually. So, if these mRNA vaccines are BS...

===
@Alex_on_A14 @JamesMelville Once again, show me a person who was vaccinated and then given a shot of covid - the truth lies there only. This is all experimental until its not - that time has not arrived with mRNA - maybe in ten years or so. Not today, not this year or next.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @JamesMelville I don't care if something is hard to test for - test it because that is the truth for immunity.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @JamesMelville It's not about 'liking' mRNA - it's about knowing and understanding the large and unstable molecule. Start there - always start with the molecule. And that's the easy part of this vaccine equation - creating B and T cells primed to detect and defeat corona....

So, I’ve made up my mind.
I wanna really go in on becoming the "Stepping Stone" for other Vtubers that I feel like and want to be.
My Numbers dont really matter to me. I don't mind hovering at 160 followers on Twitter or getting barely one view on Twitch.

From now on, I wanna help making other Vtubers happy. I wanna help them get to places high in the sky, where they deserve to be. I wanna be a Vtuber they see while they climb the ranks, offering a hand down, or boosting them up to that next rung.

@SelunaVT Look,  youve got a really squishy looking face. Its adorable.

Who wanna be the next Vtuber I capture in MC

personality. I'll get stoked when someone follows me not because they might give me a spoonful of clout, but because they may find something interesting in me as a Vtuber. I like to be able to sit back and think how I've contributed one or two followers to someone's growth here.
===
@Kaiyo248 Thats an understatment
===
It's one of the things that makes me happiest here and it's something I would like to do more often. Some may say its clout chasing, but I really couldn't care less for clout. It's a meaningless resource. I follow people cause I like something about them, whether that's looks or

100 download is basically the best you can get in Australia more or less and it is considerably better than 25.

===
@beforeyouplay_ It's so nice! Such a charming small relaxing game, and loved the story too
===
@Alex_on_A14 @slodge @greg_travis Well, during last spring I think they had to use helicopter service for a handful of patients. Nothing like that now. I believe there are certain regions that are close to full capacity, however, but coordination seems to work well.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @slodge @greg_travis That's not the point here, though? Anyway, just keep in mind that Dave's "facts" don't always add up. He's definitely not clueless, but he's got his own weird axe to grind, that's all I'm saying.
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis Yes, Dave's been pissing me off quite a bit, but I'm not really a troll. Promise. Dave's a charlatan who claims he's had SARS, that his entire family has been reinfected by covid-19and that he's suffering from long covid. Here are the figures for Stockholm -&gt; https://t.co/hO5QwRt2MJ
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis -&gt; As for my friend Dave, he's a compulsive liar who's suffering from delusions of grandeur. Have a look at these tweets and see if you find his ramblings convincing. And I haven't even mentioned anything about his glorious Amway past... https://t.co/5WNVxmyzFo
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis No, the plan for the Stockholm region was that this particular hospital wouldn't accept any more patients. For some reason the ambulances turned up anyway and had to be redirected to other hospitals. The regional hospital director in the clip says that the situation during -&gt;
===
@Alex_on_A14 @slodge @greg_travis Here are the figures for the whole country. Currently 18 % free ICU capacity. With regional differences obviously. More people admitted to hospital during the second way, fewer in ICU wards - better treatments and people admitted earlier. https://t.co/UQLPC3GPgs
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis Peak ICU occupancy is March/April last year: approx. 220. Current occupancy: approx. 80. Situation is still serious, though and the curves are going in the wrong direction. -&gt;
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis I see you've already discovered the Amway story. 😀

I don't know what Dave's angle is, but he is hellbent on skewing facts regarding the Swedish strategy. This is what his profile looked like before the pandemic, btw. And now he's a "public health epidemiologist"? 😵😐 https://t.co/eYRBTOUs6p
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis -&gt; the Saturday was actually looking better than the Friday and that there was available ICU capacity. Dave spun it to make it sound like the end is nigh. 

Yes, I'm trying to improve on the personal attacks part, but Dave has pissed me off for so long, it's not easy to let go...
===
@Alex_on_A14 @slodge @greg_travis Ask him about him buying face masks in January, how he hosted guests from Wuhan (!) in February/March (even though it was in lockdown then), how he and his entire family managed to get covid-19 twice (!) (in spite of face masks). Etc, etc. The man is a mythomaniac, unfortunately.
===
@canibeblue At least German is cool in board game circles. I can show off my German editions, even if I don’t know how to play them. Cant do that with a French expansion 😂
===
@EPluribusAnders @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis So you are ok with the claim that one hospital said its ICU was full, but you're saying that the reason it later reviewed that decision wasn't because there were no other places for people to go to?

After a year of this stuff I'm trying to steer clear of the personal attacks :)
===
@Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis I'm a bit cautious of that particular report - some of the replies point out some leaps in translation, and that particular account has some links to a "pyramid" scheme called Amway. (But he's still a useful source sometimes!)
===
@Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis Yeah... My translation skills aren't up to checking the facts on that one, let alone the nuances. There's a vaguely trollish account disputing ds's post - see https://t.co/QysqbpZ4a1 - not saying anything right now other than "I'm a bit cautious" :)
===
@Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis As I said "I'm a bit cautious" ... Just being a good guy and always
checking sources... It is weird how with sweden the contrarian anti-government crowd are the pro-lockdown campaigners... :)

@EPluribusAnders @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis Well I'm heading to bed.... So good night :)

@Alex_on_A14 Point 1 - you may be right

@Alex_on_A14 As far as I am concerned each of the 137K death certificates needs to be reviewed Alex
===
@Alex_on_A14 So we agree then? V not needed for medical reasons
===
@Alex_on_A14 I have to disagree with you over 'they aren't malign' but I do agree there is also a level of incompetence
It isn't worse than I realise; I am well aware just how corrupt and evil certain 'people' in this world are...the bar for that is very low
===
@Alex_on_A14 A domestic passport is not needed, voluntary or otherwise. Look outside of the box Alex. There are many layers to this s/s. 

V Passport for foreign travel, although I don't agree with that either, will be more dependent on what other nations decide.
===
@Alex_on_A14 Yes but how legal is it? 
It's all about dehumanising, compliance and control.
===
@Alex_on_A14 Some countries have apparently stated all welcome, seems to vary over requirement for -ve test to get in. It will depend on whether the country is tourist dependent
Yes, the issue will probably be getting back in.
Certain people hv used Common Law to get round that issue
===
@Alex_on_A14 Again you are not clear
===
@Alex_on_A14 So you support the measures that Israel have taken?
===
@Alex_on_A14 You've lost me on most of that. I asked you if you supported what is going on in Israel with regards to 'vaccine passports' or their equivalent.

There is disinfo on all sides
===
@Alex_on_A14 It's about control and surveillance. If people accept this what else will they accept?
Once something is introduced it won't be disappearing in 6 months no matter what they say.
You seem to have an unwavering belief that Govt has our best interests at heart. I don't

@Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill Florida has a 30k hole of unexplained deaths in the last year and growing. They won't say it's covid, but it's covid.
===
@TraderJ94859126 @MaxNordau @Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill Seems an odd way to go backwards to come forwards then. Going back even to July there were questions, so to see such a large reported surge so early, but later analysis for March-Sept not to reflect the expected total is odd. I shall have to look again.

https://t.co/ObWtNNrVFQ
===
@TraderJ94859126 @MaxNordau @Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill That's the bit I don't bite on. 33k more deaths for 2020, but only 19k attributed to Covid, while a plateau on other respiratory diseases while most others saw some increase (as you would expect with a growing, aging population etc).

https://t.co/f25mREBG3X
===
@Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill I suspect the "not rising" helps because those that put themselves at risk have had it, or are getting it at a reduced rate due to isolation from business practices in public. Those that aren't putting themselves at risk are insulating themselves, regardless of Abbott.
===
@TraderJ94859126 @MaxNordau @Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill Looks like it was an error in the reporting by CL Tampa / OrlandoWeekly by Alex Galbraith then, but the wording is unclear without reading the full publication as their objective stated "those exceeding historical trends after accounting for COVID-19 deaths". So is the 19k after?
===
@Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill Seemed to be a higher than normal rate of deaths through stuff that might just be Covid, or that Covid complicated and so on. Pneumonia, Flu, Heart Disease, respiratory failures etc. In effect, the instruction is to not record Covid without a positive test.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill It's a start at unpicking the misinfo from Florida, and there are a few other states that have refused to use the Excess Death metric everyone else has.

All red states aligning behind Trumps refusal to close down /wear mask / wash hands / inject bleach / insert UV-anal tube etc.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill Another issue with unpicking Florida (and where my currently erroneous 30k came from) was the expected lack of deaths from other causes. As per the UK we have had greater excess deaths, but had fewer deaths from other diseases than Covid. Last I saw Florida was being silly.
===
@MaxNordau @Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill That isn't what it said. The 33k is current official covid total.

However when comparing their 5 year avg vs those months the total excess was 15% higher, so another 14,000 deaths not currently attributed to Covid.

Florida refuses to use CDC standard for excess death calcs. https://t.co/eePlLfzsdh
===
@Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill Here is the raw morbidity for Florida the last 4 years showing that 33k jump.

Then under their individual stats a variety of nips, tucks, each significantly above population growth %.

But a plateau in respiratory where you would expect a decline due to the prevalence of Covid? https://t.co/l6BPKJFhTM
===
@Alex_on_A14 @AThankless @M1k3ySCC @jneill I'm not sure I should trust someone who thinks 15.5% of 33,000 is 14,000.
===
@AThankless @TraderJ94859126 @Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill The question is not "Is there imprecision in death statistics?"

The question is: "Is there anything extraordinary or suspicious about Florida's numbers relative to other states?"

The answer: No, there isn't.

https://t.co/mKECUH96iZ
===
@AThankless @MaxNordau @Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill What the article conveniently leaves out is what the rest of the nations excess deaths look like, or that many respected data scientists have said they don’t think anything suspicious is going on... https://t.co/XE01L6FKZP
===
@AThankless @MaxNordau @Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill https://t.co/PbrE46rT4a

The 15.5% excess actually works out to 19k, of which 14k were attributed to covid and have been counted in the states covid tally. The other 5k were not attributed to covid. Where are you getting your info from? https://t.co/qYMmd6yRLn
===
@AThankless @MaxNordau @Alex_on_A14 @M1k3ySCC @jneill Orlando looks like they have correctly updated. CL Tampa not so much.

19k was total excess deaths
14k/19k were classified as covid + counted in official reporting
5k/19k were not classified as covid but its being suggested some of it should have been https://t.co/1UhG8sbdGN

@Asmodee_USA @beforeyouplay_ @UnexpectGames Cryptology is the study of codes, in general!  Both encryption and decryption.  👍
===
@WhoWhatWhyCast @canibeblue The nostalgia factor is a big reason too, and brand recognition (which coincides with familiarity) but I think it's very telling that when introduced to modern board games, lots of people don't really go back to games like Clue and Monopoly (I work at a board game cafe)
===
@WhoWhatWhyCast @canibeblue Interesting that you'd add familiarity to that list! I don't tend to play a game even if it is hugely familiar to me unless I find it enjoyable, so familiarity is just a byproduct of me just playing games I like. Do you feel differently?

@mcdon_al @aranmlewis @BarnabyRaine Over what? Over the fact that your view, without your supporting it with data, IS subjective?

Nah, don't think so.
===
@mcdon_al @aranmlewis @BarnabyRaine You're saying that your subjective view over-rides anyone else's experience. That's fundamentally arrogant, notwithstanding your confidence in your own subjectivity. You've also not shown any link between uniform &amp; the also-subjective "good behaviour".
===
@PeterSh83963588 @graciemaybe @aranmlewis You're right.
In this case it was HMIC, also staffed with ex-coppers, ex-Civil Servants &amp; former military officers. Again, the very epitome of independence.
===
@mcdon_al @aranmlewis @BarnabyRaine I went to 2ndary school in the '70s. Just about every school across SW London had a strict uniform policy. It did the sum total of DICK regarding the learning environment. That was down to the skills &amp; engagement of the teachers, not branding.
===
@graciemaybe @aranmlewis IOPC, the "independent" inspectorate, is staffed mostly with ex-coppers. How odd they'd find their brethren to have acted "proportionately".
===
@aranmlewis @graciemaybe Tom Winsor has been an Establishment bootlicker since back when he was parachuted into the Rail Regulator seat. He shat the bed there, but it didn't affect his upward trajectory. He's living proof of the Peter Principle.
===
@aranmlewis @mcdon_al @BarnabyRaine A friend who teaches at an academy, uses that colourful American expression about senior staff there: "They've all drunk the kool-aid, or pretend to have".
===
@aranmlewis @AndrewSherman19 @BarnabyRaine Yep. I agree that there are probably many issues in that Academy and that the students probably have various grievances that are entirely legitimate - the changes to the curriculum appear to be one. My point was and is about the uniform policy...
===
@AndrewSherman19 @aranmlewis @BarnabyRaine The contemporary school system is very different to the 1970’s. Having taught in a number of London schools I can say with confidence that schools with good behaviour are better, full stop. Without that the quality of teaching falls by the wayside. It’s fundamentally important.
===
@AndrewSherman19 @aranmlewis @BarnabyRaine Have a word with yourself.

Canadians across the board are afraid to really discuss what racism is and how the Canadian empire uses it to manipulate its population as a distraction from wholesale robbing of wealth and dismantling government oversight of corporate criminality.
===
That racism report has a point. The British empire was nothing but a force of good in the world.

Free trips to the Caribbean for West Africans (slaves trade)
Building the Indian railway (more efficiently extract their resources)
Free room and board in Kenya (concentration camp)

===
@4ChitsNGiggles @canibeblue I think one of the reasons that monopoly, clue, uno, et al endure is familiarity. The rules are not complex and are often passed down without reading the rulebook (for better or worse). Families teach them to their children bc the games are familiar to them.
===
@4ChitsNGiggles @canibeblue It has something that keeps bringing people back to it, be that variability, familiarity, excessive fun.
===
@canibeblue @dani_standring Oh, and it was spread because no one could resist huffing the bag. No one.
===
@terraternity @BoardGameHalv @beforeyouplay_ @WarMagnets Thank you for the mention &lt;3
===
@Alex_on_A14 @SusieFrmSeattle All adverse events should be reported.

That doesn't mean the adverse event is causally linked to the vaccine and VAERS does NOT suggest that causation has been determined.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @SusieFrmSeattle Using that response they will come back with the anti-vax rumor that only 1% of adverse events are reported.
===
@terraternity @beforeyouplay_ @Dinasaidso1 @WarMagnets Thank you Terraternity!
===
@canibeblue @4ChitsNGiggles Yeah for me the distinction is, can you play the same setup many times?  Games that tend to be more "puzzly", you can't, so the variability comes from the game giving you a different puzzle to solve each time.  That's fine, I just like player-driven variability more.
===
@4ChitsNGiggles @canibeblue A game /saying of itself/ that it has good replayability is marketingspeak and I don't actually know what to make of that!

I would /assume/ it means setup variability, "it's different every time" type of thing.

What I personally look for is different than that, though.
===
@4ChitsNGiggles @canibeblue For me replayability comes from an emphasis on player interaction and the endless variability humans can exhibit.  Games like Carcassonne, Lost Cities and No Thanks have endless replay despite using the same setup, because of the player interaction.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @LondonT38061214 @buchanan17 @jneill @profnfenton I would say even from personal experience of never having obeyed any rules, hugged family, saw all our friends, behaved normally etc, from the start, not one of us have ever had or know of anyone who has had covid. If there was asymptomatic spread then someone should have got it.
===
@canibeblue @Weaktwos *gasp* IT WAS YOU!
===
@Tydaspy @canibeblue It’s literally half the battle with TTS. I’m glad I started off playing games I already knew to ease my way in.

@Alex_on_A14 As I have said already, Sweden will have busy hospitals but less in the mortuaries in this 3rd wave. The vaccines have a clear effect amongst the most vulnerable but haven't reached enough older adults yet.

@Alex_on_A14 And most importantly, we aren't going out of our minds, our kids well-being is protected, most businesses are hanging in there and so, yes, we can hold out a few weeks more with the restrictions we have, which I get the impression is not the case across much of the continent.

@ArcusArmis Thank you~! &gt;&lt;💕💕
===
@Alex_on_A14 @ClareCraigPath That's interesting. These are the actual numbers from the ONS published last week (https://t.co/iK7U1MboqM):
16thOct-12thMar:
Excess deaths: 54,199
C19 Deaths: 86,650

The last 5 year average is ONS 2015-19, with the addition of adding in the 2020 Jan/Feb (so 6 years av J/F)
===
@Alex_on_A14 @Ariel_Adam @ClareCraigPath No-one seems to have any idea why there are more reported C19 deaths than excess deaths in the UK. Could it be that C19 deaths are not C19 deaths and that the PCR test manufactures are correct when they say theirs tests are not for mass testing.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @ClareCraigPath These numbers for excess deaths are the ONS weekly all cause deaths compared to the last year average. The C19 deaths are the ONS weekly reported. For the last 5 months C19 deaths have exceeded excess deaths. Car crash + Fatal work accidents less than 2k per year, not that many. https://t.co/OQlOm6PG7s
===
@Alex_on_A14 @ClareCraigPath Your graph is showing C19 deaths exceeding excess deaths but just more granular, ie. daily not weekly. Is that right?

===
@canibeblue @moregamespls Oh man, I didn’t even intend for the connection like that, but you’re completely right. Just completely giving in to the Id and taking whatever the body “needs” whether that’s food, socialization, toilet paper... ugh. Covid has exposed a lot of not great behaviors...
===
@Alex_on_A14 @OldMackIsBack My view has always been, break in, and you leave your rights outside my door.
===
@ccK6oGou1TM5bco I don’t know why you would find that offensive to your civil rights - don’t you like freedom of choice? I do.
===
@ccK6oGou1TM5bco Yeah one thing has nothing to do with the other. We already need vaccination proof when we travel to various countries and when you enroll in school - as well as for certain jobs. You’re paranoid.
===
@ccK6oGou1TM5bco Apparently not - I have an outstanding win rate at trial. The bottom line is we’re not going to cater to you having to live in fear of a shot.
===
@ccK6oGou1TM5bco Put another way. You’re not victims. Stop playing the victim card. You’re a perpetrator.
===
@ccK6oGou1TM5bco No it’s a term for people who are scientific illiterates, and too self obsessed with their ignorance to participate in public health mitigation during a pandemic. They’ve resulted in countless needless deaths and will keep doing so.
===
@ccK6oGou1TM5bco No I’m suggesting unless they have a valid medical reason that they shouldn’t be on buses at all. Some people can’t get the vaccine and they need exemptions. You’re just a snowflake
===
@ccK6oGou1TM5bco @Sueshuz @reggcohn @TorontoStar What barricades....there will be plenty of places for disease carrying rat lickers to congregate. Rat lickers bars, restaurants ....you name it.
===
@ccK6oGou1TM5bco Yeah you won’t because it looks like you guys got screwed on your vaccine allocations and are heading for another lock down. And in addition to that you live in … Canada
===
@ccK6oGou1TM5bco No “dude“ turns out my first career was in biological research. So I actually do have a pretty good understanding the science involved. You’re just a shivering little purse dog afraid to get a shot.

@Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis @PienaarJm if it is really from blood donors its strange, didnt they learn from Manaus data? (also old age people dont donate blood so it would be even more strange)
===
@Alex_on_A14 @Deano_123 @AmeliaBell2 @DavidSteadson For denialist is always the vaccine fault, if you vaccinate Will its rising they are also killing or dont do nothing, if cases are going down its not the vaccines but something else 😂
===
@Deano_123 @Alex_on_A14 @AmeliaBell2 @DavidSteadson Strange that in Portugal we are still vaccinating that group and none of that is happening 🧐 (its exactly the opposite) https://t.co/kMlmr8QMMk
===
@Deano_123 @Alex_on_A14 @AmeliaBell2 @DavidSteadson Sure we can go There , but your post was not about this but a probable Rise Of cases/deaths with vacination , we are vaxxing more people now here in pt and cases are always going down so That Logic here doesnt work
===
@Deano_123 @Alex_on_A14 @AmeliaBell2 @DavidSteadson Our drop in cases are not from vaccination, like you Said we dont have enough, in my opinion it was the lockdown in january 10. What vaccination seems to be doing is That deaths in care homes (first to get a shot) went down Faster then other pop age Bracket

===
@SaltaoVladimir @Alex_on_A14 @AmeliaBell2 @DavidSteadson So the massive drop off started well before the 4th Feb, before they had got to even vaccinating 3% of their population with one dose? That's some vaccine. Or could there be another reason? https://t.co/ePnHVa3Dtx
===
@Alex_on_A14 @AThankless @ParkinJim Thanks. I want the right decision to be made using the right data, otherwise we are either being locked up for nothing. As I said in another tweet dispatches covered this in Nov so its not new.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @andylumm @MrQuantity @TakethatCt @AThankless @ParkinJim @carlsmythe @InCytometry I don't think that is going to fly, I think the difficult stuff is the stuff they want.

@aranmlewis @NermaJelacic It's 'useful idiocy' only if it is unintentional. I am generally in favour of presuming incompetence ahead of malice, but it does not apply here.

@Gamefreakgeek @canibeblue @CityofGamesHQ I don't mind the solitary idea of it -- similar to Calico in that I have to puzzle things out whether by myself or with others. But the idea that this isn't even the full game and it's less than $9 leads the mind to all the possibilities.
===
@Alex_on_A14 If I understand you correctly, I agree. It's still a useful exercise to test, 100%. But, how that data is interpreted will need to change. I suspect for the UK cases will stay fairly level for a while, but I suspect hospitalisations will continue to drop as will fatalities.

@PapayonTrading @CardsEnzo that's some bullshit

@Alex_on_A14 @ClareCraigPath Judging you have symptoms is very subjective.

The spread caused by being in the group who cannot that has caused most of the spread, is not.

It is was subjective it would have an R as low as Flu instead of one 5x higher, and we'd have had no LD.

@MrQuantity @Alex_on_A14 @TakethatCt @Deano_123 @AThankless @ParkinJim @carlsmythe @InCytometry EQA is being done "in the UK"

Lighthouse labs were questioned by IBMS etc, at start of pandemic
Government should have increased NHS lab capacity, but we would have told them for good quality, need time and money, not 4 days training as shown on panaroma.

@StopCoronavir12 @Alex_on_A14 Which are both excellent things!
===
@boardgamerpinup Not a good apology but I'm glad he's out nonetheless.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @Deano_123 @AThankless @ParkinJim @InCytometry @TakethatCt I am and have direct contacts in testing centre.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @Deano_123 @AThankless @ParkinJim @InCytometry @TakethatCt Poor hiring practice. And the contamination risk though definitely present, should be found by cluster analysis of any positive signals in a run. 

So not good practice, but not surprising given the volumes involved
===
@beforeyouplay_ @Zmangames_ @SenFoongLim @bamboozlebros Been really tempting but never been able to get a copy in the UK.
===
@carlsmythe @Alex_on_A14 @Deano_123 @AThankless @InCytometry @TakethatCt From what I saw on the news last night, the poor hiring practice, and maybe training/management at the Milton Keynes lighthouse lab might have been an issue. But the numbers show the FP rate is small.
===
@1minboardgames @Gamefreakgeek @PlayRenegade @beforeyouplay_ It's our favorite. No matter what difficulty setting you try it on, it's a great puzzle
===
@boardgamerpinup Thank you! You can always go back to blue 💙 The fun of fantasy hair color is that it’s easy to shift to new colors. I think one day I will return to pink and purple hair. But for now, it’s easier to match blue with clothes lol.
===
@diclexicon @Alex_on_A14 @ClareCraigPath Yes they do. Just not stupid people who think excess deaths is the same every year.
===
@Alex_on_A14 That is shocking. Just unbelievable.
===
@ArcusArmis But violence
===
@ArcusArmis Nah the company is legit, they own the internet in this building and I was with them previously but it was included in my lease so now I’m manually renewing the plan
===
@beforeyouplay_ @SenFoongLim @bamboozlebros @Zmangames_ You two make some killer vids! Loved it!

@beforeyouplay_ Thanks for the video! I LOVE this game. I might be wrong, but I believe you can't place cubes of the same colour on a tile?
===
@ArcusArmis It would actually be Poggies! Awawawa

@ElderberryEnt I've been following this insanity, maybe more relevant to us since we spent six months on a ship as long as this freighter. We lived on board the S.S. Norway; Eden and Sam were performing nightly in B'way-style shows, and its Viking Deck also the length of the Empire State Bldg.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @docrussjackson I'm angry that he and his colleagues have not been given Ivermectin as a preventative, when it has been proved to work, and could have saved so many bloody lives since Dec/January.
===
@ArcusArmis Yeah, why don't you talk to Lilith - I heard she's really cool and down to Earth and sexy and funny and smart and stuff. 😌💖
===
@ColinTaylor73 @LollysMum1 Wonder what bright spark thought that one up. 

"Let's get a really 'Famous' celeb on board".... "I know , let's get that unknown boxer who is a Member of The British Empire" 

That'll.get the Scottish Republicans and the radicals  on side.

Sure fire vote winner.

FUDS.
===
@ArcusArmis They’re always open 😂

@BG_HotTakes @beforeyouplay_ @sowronggames @BluePegPinkPeg @brdgamebarrage @DanThurot @2MomsGame @3minboardgames @ShutUpShow @thesecretcabal @meepletowngames @BoardOfItReview So kind, thank you!!!
===
@Alex_on_A14 @TakethatCt @Deano_123 @AThankless @ParkinJim @carlsmythe @InCytometry 9 months ago EQA was recommended to be done in the UK 

Yeadon spoke about it even if he made errors elsewhere 

Since some of you prefer swearing and gifs so be it
===
@TakethatCt @Alex_on_A14 @Deano_123 @AThankless @ParkinJim @carlsmythe @InCytometry What?

Like all the external quality assessment which could have shown this months ago, way back in 2020?
===
@beforeyouplay_ @SenFoongLim @bamboozlebros @Zmangames_ Great video
===
@BG_HotTakes @beforeyouplay_ @sowronggames @BluePegPinkPeg @brdgamebarrage @DanThurot @2MomsGame @3minboardgames @ShutUpShow @thesecretcabal @meepletowngames Oh and btw were British but absolutely more than happy to get mistaken for Australian we must have good lighting 😂😂😂

Among other things, they highlight my inadequacy with the use of the English language :) Thanks for the things you do for the hobby and your wordsmithery.

===
@BG_HotTakes @beforeyouplay_ @sowronggames @BluePegPinkPeg @brdgamebarrage @2MomsGame @3minboardgames @ShutUpShow @thesecretcabal @meepletowngames @BoardOfItReview Oh no, now I'm blushing. Thank you, genuinely — hopefully I can live up to it!

Enjoyed today's episode, BTW. Looking forward to listening from now on. Always nice to hear some introspection about the methods we use, and your decision to follow up on past reviews is laudable.
===
@BG_HotTakes @beforeyouplay_ @sowronggames @BluePegPinkPeg @brdgamebarrage @2MomsGame @3minboardgames @ShutUpShow @thesecretcabal @meepletowngames @BoardOfItReview Ah, very kind of you to think of me!

@Alex_on_A14 @Deano_123 @AThankless @ParkinJim @carlsmythe @InCytometry Need to see the details of the programme 

Alan McNally may have something
===
@boardgamerpinup Good.

@Alex_on_A14 I can refer to someone that can help you get it back @TobiasCyber he did mine and my account is fully back.
