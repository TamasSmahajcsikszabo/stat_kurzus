@Glorinsz they were/are trying to compete with the MCU and it just isn‚Äôt possible. Marvel/Disney capitalized on the ‚Äúsuper-hero‚Äù movie genre so much better than any one in history that people tried to copy that. as a comic book nerd, its sad that DC comics adaptations have become a joke.

High Noon (1952)
A depressing 'sheriff defending a town from a posse' movie that never lets up the tension for its entire runtime
I can see why that bum John Wayne hated it, it is kind of a subversion of the macho sheriff genre. 8/10 https://t.co/Au6HpfINyq

@TitanSmashMTG Rating the same or slightly less. I didn't really dig the subversion of the "tournament" genre conventions. Compare to a movie like Enter the Dragon where there's plenty of intrigue between rounds and MK is a hasty mess.

23. Coming Home in the Dark: A brutally tense movie. They establish almost immediately that anything could happen, and as we learn about the villains we only worry more about how far they‚Äôll go. Those villains are also more interesting than you‚Äôd expect from this genre. 5 stars.

that the Seizerberg comedies and Scary Movie V both ruined the genre.

@tomflood1 Basic Instinct? Of all the forgot genres, the 90s erotic thriller genre is potentially the weirdest. Its like American directors couldn't sell arthouse, so they just injected 15 minutes of porn into a crime movie where the perp was a seductive woman and called it a day.
===
@thatSeanBarry my original post was because I feel like people complain on here when every kaiju movie comes out that there's too much plot, so it seems like there's just a disconnect between the actual genre and what people want from it
===
@teamlucasfan @Hisloveliftedme @Sandieed08 @Kelly10896456 I don't like this genre either but I was curious to see Chris in it.  Not easy making the audience relate to his character in this movie.  I'm definitely impressed by his acting in this movie but it is not an easy movie to watch.
===
And it definitely comes down to the time in which a film is released and where the genre, franchise or just cinema in general is at during that period.

Colour is just like cinematography or score in that sense, and audiences do not react well to when the norm is challenged.

What I love about this movie is that it‚Äôs likely the most indie-feeling animated movie right now-it has music by Los Campesinos!, Alex Lahey and Sigur Ros in it-and Katie straight up references indie folk as a GENRE in one scene which took me for a loop #TheMitchellsVsTheMachines

@TorgHacker I'm afraid this is a little bit like asking "is there a live-action movie which would be good to watch to discover if I like movies"; anime is a medium more than a genre.  We'll need to narrow down what you like.

@KillerSKULL__ @JumboGibbon091 @GameSpot Okay this is what I‚Äôm saying games all have to have a game type format therefore for me. They can not pack the same emotional punch a movie can.

@josefbutwithanF //I want this movie so much now. Like thinking about how it could be a combination of so many genre's if they really wanted to make it an homage to the sims. It could be a full blown series of movies just based on the stories of Pleasantview--mystery, romantic comedy, etc.üíö

@ReissFerguson yo i have not been this excited for a marvel movie in so long, im actually so unbelievably excited for this movie its crazy. i have full faith in sam and im so ready for the campy horror elements he'll bring. i love his style and the genre needs more goofy campy stuff im so hyped

@FutureboyWho @themaxhuang I get it. I love music in general. Any type of genre as long as it's positive and passionate. Music is timeless for me. In any era, I'd love it. I may have a cool idea for how the next movie could at least start for Johnny's introduction.

@FivePointsVids Something not too far-fetched in subject matter, but really well-crafted, and ideally not too confined to one genre so they can see the range of what's possible in a movie... Maybe Fargo or The Big Lebowski?
===
@jerryleewilson Yea I agree - can‚Äôt see the point of having him. Was like Trump - not a comedian, not an actor - no experience on the genre so it‚Äôs going to be painful - it will look forced, be unfunny and my thumb will be sore from pressing fast forward.

#FilmTwitter
Here's something to discuss w/ Mortal Kombat getting the exact same reviews video game movies ALWAYS get: "not great, could've been good."

But is it possible for a video game movie to be good? By good, I mean that it compares favorably to movies in its genre. https://t.co/V2MGII20Zl
===
@Rob_Motto Imo, it's not possible.
I don't think any video game movie will compare favorably to even the average movies in whatever genre it's in.

I do hope to be proved wrong someday. But if I held my breath waiting, my brain would die.
===
@philamsel Good example in Rampage! So maybe it could work if they're not working w/ ANY story whatsoever? Just adapting a game's action into a fun action film?

Silent Hill, yeah it's okay for a video game movie, but I wouldn't say it stands very tall in the genre.

The lower rating your horror movie, the more nudity/sexual activity you have to put in it. I didn't make the rules, its a staple of the genre.

i remember being really put off by it when i first watched it in high school because it was sold as a straight romcom. not the case! straight romcoms are not allowed to be so gut-wrenching! but good god, whatever genre you put it in, it‚Äôs a perfect movie.

@JustinTHoffman You‚Äôre not terrible so no worries. I can‚Äôt totally pin down a genre. I‚Äôll watch anything with a good story, beautiful cinematography, or makes me laugh. I love classic Hollywood movies. 

I feel like you‚Äôd like this indie sci fi movie on Amazon, The Vast of Night.

It's family, @IMDb. Not just on screen, but among the writers, cast, &amp; crew, &amp; among the fandom &amp; it's global. Believe it or not, you can find strong love, kindness, &amp; found family themes in genre. A woman can be a "hero &amp; a wife," "a single mom."

Remember when Batman Begins came out and we were all starry eyed at the notion of a grimdark superhero movie that took itself seriously? Amazing what two decades of Pentagon funding will do to a genre and the broader industry, huh.

@RockSWPA @geoffelkins @RealRexDoom @rooster_puncher @SoulStereo2581 @ryanwinn @Timobros I love him too. I'm watching The Night Comes For Us as I tweet. Goddamn this movie fire. He created something I thought I'd never ever see Martial Slasher genre.

@daisymyonly @lovelltrin I another problem is that the female revenge genre is so over saturated with movies about SA. We never get a movie where to go on to avenge a loved one or something like that.

===
@DevaniAnjali I can totally see why you were bored if you were looking for story. The story is irrelevant. "Pulp Fiction" stories are always sensationalized junk food. The movie was a treatment of the genre, with gritty characters, and clever storytelling/editing (won an Oscar for editing too)

Many (if not most) road movies assume a masculine point of view. Here's a video essay that unpacks how the female gaze of 'American Honey' redefines the boundaries of the genre: https://t.co/1OUnukoAHn https://t.co/Q3Mayv8PW4

===
When a movie, show, or game is made based on a franchise, genre, or sub-genre I love, I don't want a reimagining, I don't want the limits of the genre pushed.

I want my tastes pandered to. That's why I'm there in the first place.

Seriously.
===
@crisp_versioned @dream_catalogue Still, I think this is a decent direction to go, but the genre needs a catalyst (a big movie soundtrack ie Synthwave, huge collaborations ie Hyperpop, K-pop frenzy / mega hit Gangnam Style). Doesn‚Äôt have to be exactly that, but an event of that magnitude.

Action shouldn‚Äôt be a movie genre

The civil war part of Captain America Civil War ruined the movie for me. It did when I watched it and Falcon and Winter Soldier drove home that they sacrificed what was really an unique story within the Superhero genre to cram in an Avengers-lite movie.

@Wizards_DnD Slasher horror. Scream was the one movie that made me love the genre.

@boogiepest 1) In Bruges (Genre: Black Comedy, keeps you on edge, has Colin Farrell)

No but seriously, check the genre of the story you're going for before starting a show guys.

That type of movie has not aged well, too many cheap imitations have spoiled the plot. Thankfully a talented cast and director still keep up the interest.

My new favorite film genre: character actor from the British Isles wanders around a foreign country having humorous misadventures and finding genuine human connection whilst engaging in bittersweet reflections on life https://t.co/RiMPInhaqB

@BrndnStrssng I think there‚Äôs been decent ones but this genre hasn‚Äôt really had its Superman: The Movie or Batman 89. Think TV is fundamentally where a lot of these stories should be told (Mortal Kombat could have been ‚Äúthe next Game of Thrones‚Äù, easily)

@therapy_cinema Love the subject of this one, I feel like PTSD is really overlooked in the super hero genre.
===
I find it kind of funny I was worried the gore might bother me. I have to learn never to believe people who say big budget genre movies "pull no punches" or are incredibly gruesome.

I've seen clips from the games WAY more disturbing than anything in this movie.

Here, my good friend, @hibachijustice breaks down why certain fight scenes work and why some don‚Äôt work. It‚Äôs odd that Action genre cinema is seen as B-grade by those high brow. But it takes a lot of skill &amp; observation to shoot and cut an action scene effectively. https://t.co/GjikG8CFrE

@renee_fournier best chris evans movie best spoof film changed the genre forever
===
@Addison_Peacock @lostthenumbers It walks the line between a burlesque of that genre/era of movie and earnest. I love it
===
@MKMovie I loved this movie it brought back my childhood and a nostalgic moment with a fresh spin it gave the genre a story that could be felt without leaving the action.  I pray I want have to wait another decade + to get another movie #mortalkombatuniverse

Horror has to be the worst movie genre to ever exist

@Vee21333842 @qRussss @mikehorneresq @JoeConchaTV Uff, Girl. Seriously, its ok if we have diffrent view on politics, day to day things, or movie genre we like.

But seriously NOT SCIENCE. Science is scared, its not political!

Just do some research on your own , for how any vaccine works. U will understand what i m talking abt.

@GunRoswall I think that's a general phenomenon if you look at genre fiction, not just women-loving women fiction. Or look at the movie industry. Most characters are 20-30 somthings, perfectly healthy, not struggling financially, attractive, etc. 

Some readers want that escape.

1987 (Jeremy Brett as Holmes, his first film after being treated for manic depression): Tonga is played by Kiran Shah, an Indian-Kenyan actor who is still alive and has had a very busy genre career as an actor and stunt double.

@Jerbsinator @YongYea Ah yes thats why they are triple-ing the studio, expand internationally, expand destiny into movie and show, make spinoffs as other genres and is the most successful game in its genre. 

And all vault content coming back is 100% free.

@letterboxd A classic of French cinema, sleazy exploitation, some great cinema from Japan and a movie that a dumb Nic Cage genre film but is no Drive Angry https://t.co/Z9qXvYWgr5

REVIEW But like any formidable genre vehicle, #Stowaway is much more than its form, writes @reelreptile. Read his review of the #Netflix film, starring #AnnaKendrick and Toni Collette: https://t.co/48c11llmn7

@naptownball He's in the convo for the GOAT actor that's why lol. One genre can't hold him

Recommend me a nice show/movie to watch? Any genre but thriller/sci-fi are a plus

Been rewatching Westworld Season 3 and ‚ÄòGenre‚Äô remains an awful episode that could have been better if not for Genre. Also, I love the Riot Control bot and think the world might be ready for an ABC Warriors movie or TV series. cc @2000AD https://t.co/OmjbCMLNa2
