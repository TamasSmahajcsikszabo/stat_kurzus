@ole_b_peters @sevendeuce89 @TSheri14 If a region doesn't eliminate Covid there is a chance it can mutate and thrive. Diverting vaccinations elsewhere before immunity may empower virus as opposed to reduce its territory piece-by piece. There's an argument for putting own oxygen mask on before helping neighbors.
