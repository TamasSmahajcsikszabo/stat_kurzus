@GailSimone Barney Rubble eats Dinosaurs for dinner every night. If and When I see evidence that Barney Fife regularly eats cavemen I might consider changing my vote.

@GailSimone Barney Fife is only good one-on-one. One bullet.

@GailSimone And his firearm safety training!

@GailSimone Rubble &amp; Dinosaur are natural enemies so they ignore Fife to rekindle their blood feud. Which gives Fife the time to recover from shock, load his 1 bullet, &amp; blow away  the tool-using Rubble, who killed Dinosaur with a stump or brontosaurus shopping cart.

@GailSimone According to a children's song, the dinosaur has been tied to a tree and killed with knife and hatchet. Fife only has one bullet, not loaded. Rubble regularly encounters sabertooth tigers and Bam-Bam's strength has to come from somewhere (could be Betty). I'm going with Rubble.

Oh yeah, I should write out my thoughts. IMO, aF is not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. It came out at a bad time where people were expecting another entry in the mainline series (same with HHD). It‚Äôs a cute little game to make use of your AC amiibo figures and cards.

It's simple to learn...the ONLY complex bit is sometimes figuring out the order of effects, but I suspect that's part of the fun. Like all great card-based games, there's elation and frustration and lots of cursing when someone takes the base YOU wanted. 

Great!

In the newest set, you can play The Horned King from Black Cauldron (bit of an obscurity, which I like), Gaston from Beauty and the Beast, or Lady Tremaine from Cinderella. 

Each has separate victory conditions, so play is very different each game.

Did people forget Barney Fife's extensive martial arts training?
===
That‚Äôs it for this thread of #TableTopGails!

Both games =WAY highly recommended.

Thank you so much to @TheOpGames https://t.co/S7inedjLEF
And @alderac    https://t.co/pkoeMGhQMt

And @RavensburgerNA    https://t.co/9Vidosvax3

We‚Äôve never played a bad game from any of these!
===
@mzspell @RocketSpouse @JoCoCruise @kccmpbl That concert was one of the coolest things I had ever experienced.
===
HUG!

But also I was totally right!  :)

Thank you for sharing this. https://t.co/xllNVK5oZs
===
The idea is, there are lots of bases, famous locations in the Marvel Universe. On your turn, you send characters to those bases, or have them perform actions, to try to control those bases.  The basic rules are simple, but there is a LOT of variety.

You move your piece on your game board, and play cards to achieve your particular victory goal. Because it‚Äôs different for each character, it‚Äôs hard to summarize.

But you do feel the heat when the other players are near their goal!

The entire product is first class, the box design, the interior card insert, and the art in the cards is gorgeous, great art from the comics themselves,

If there was a Der Wienerschnitzel in the fields that guy in the Baba O'Riley song wouldn't have to fight all the time.
===
Next!  When I first asked for suggestions for board games to play during quarantine, I think this was the NUMBER ONE suggestion. It‚Äôs DISNEY VILLAINOUS by @RavensburgerNA!

Now, like Smash-up, there are several sets, including Marvel, that can be combined or played alone.

14/ https://t.co/LyuZ9esBdx
===
@GovKemp You are a liar and a disgrace.
===
So, for all of you who raved about this game to me, YOU WERE RIGHT, DAMMIT. :)

It‚Äôs fun just for the game. But if you are a Disney fan, a Marvel fan, or just plain want to see the bad guy win, you will love this game. We can‚Äôt wait to add in the other expansion sets!

===
The thing is, the game just looks and feels great. Unlike Smash-Up and other card games, this one feels more stealth and strategic, so there‚Äôs less frenzy at least when we played, but just as much fun. You play the worst of the worst!

For a card based game, it‚Äôs lush!

I keep talking about how the design and art of board games has taken such a jump upward. It may seem a little thing, but it makes a huge difference in how a game FEELS when your card and board set up looks this awesome.

Also, did you know Gambit is a huge narc? https://t.co/81N7yvnBzW
===
First is MARVEL SMASH-UP by @TheOpGames, and 
DISNEY‚ÄôS VILLAINOUS: DESPICABLE PLOTS by @RavensburgerNA!

Both of these games are hit series, these are the specific sets we played...both are standalone AND expansion sets.  

Common factor was FUN.

@ivorysorceress You are amazing and you are a FLAWLESS Diana!

@GarryGourlay I think it might be a LITTLE complex for the average 7 year old...
===
The funnest thing in this is, these are all versions of the story where the bad guys WIN. 

Each player has different goals, and plays in their own 'realm.' But your opponent can play FATE cards to mess you up!

18/
===
@zeroefficiency I wonder if a sequel is on the way, maybe?
===
What the FUCK https://t.co/cj2sPR3Oqz
===
This game is a big hit, and has crossed over into the mainstream market really well. But man, it‚Äôs just such a beautiful game. For a Disney fan like me, it‚Äôs a dream to look at and play.

We only have the newest set,  DESPICABLE PLOTS right now, but...

===
Okay, there has actually been a bit of a lull in #MagicPorch activity, so in today's #TabletopGails, we played two games that were among the MOST SUGGESTED by you!

WOOT!   They are by two of my favorite companies, too.

This was FUN.  Let's see what they are!

1/
===
@CM_Pepper @RocketSpouse You could still be evil!
===
My favorite! https://t.co/w7wPExwxIj
===
@bebarce What magic?
===
@AKongoman Oh, no! I am sorry!
===
Which Barney wins in a fight?
===
The fun thing about it is, you have several 'factions' in each box. The Marvel set has eight. Each player picks two.

In the Marvel set, they are Hydra, Sinister Six, Spider-Verse, Ultimates, Avengers, SHIELD, Kree, and the Masters of Evil.  You combine your forces!

5/
===
I‚Äôm glad it worked out! https://t.co/aX2EIme5zG
===
I may get some of this a bit off, please correct me if I'm wrong. SMASH UP is a hit series card game for two players and up. I believe it came from @alderac and the one we're playing, Marvel, is co-produced with @TheOpGames.

They have LOTS of  sets, which can combine.
4/ https://t.co/ie5DFoQohT
===
@ziggiedogg @RocketSpouse RAY! It was such a pleasure to meet you both!
===
WELL IT IS!

Is that @travelingmanuk? https://t.co/zKGIhPN7fn
===
@PDXBroadsides @ChristianLipski Aw, you!
===
@alderac @TheOpGames YAY! I was worried I'd mess that up.  :)

Also, we LOVE this game!
===
Ha!  Often, they slow down so the other doggos can retain their self esteem. :) https://t.co/1yporeLaTU
===
What makes that even more fun is, you can use factions from other sets, to have sharks and Hydra, or Spider-verse Fairy Princesses.

The game is fun just for the mechanics, but the added delight of mixing teams raises it to another level.

We only have the Marvel set, these.

6/ https://t.co/PZMco4T2AZ
===
You get victory points for each base you conquer (there are partial victories, too, which adds a fun twist). The person with 15 victory points wins.

So our review is, this game is so fun we want to get the other sets like right NOW.

@GailSimone Kaiju wins. Everytime.
===
@GailSimone Barney the dinosaur survived a meteorite
===
@GailSimone Team Fife all the way
===
@GailSimone What! No Gumble!?
===
@GailSimone There was the time #IMetGail at... the place... and you totally said you'd help me move this furniture, and i could stay at your place for a week or two. What's in the fridge?
===
@GailSimone Barney The Dinosaur is a kaiju.
===
@GailSimone Yeah but Rubble has dino power https://t.co/NmZNLIev9x
===
@GailSimone In 1950s America? He'd have been extremely proficient in classic Greco-Roman wrestling, which of course requires full nudity.
===
@GailSimone Y‚Äôall think Barney Rubble ain‚Äôt got shit for a dinosaur. That dude RIDES dinosaurs.
===
@cshabsin @barrydeutsch @GailSimone In his pocket.
===
@GailSimone Barney Gumble. https://t.co/3hVHNPbied
===
@GailSimone I didn't. Also, he's got a gun and one bullet so as long as it's a one-on-one fight he has the advantage.
===
@GailSimone Barney Rubble is a damn caveman who stops cars with his bare feet. No contest.
===
@stareagle @GailSimone True.
===
@GailSimone Hi, hope your day went well. will you be working another comic writing class in the future? that was very entertaining and I learned a lot from it.
===
@GailSimone Barney Fife would win as there would never end up being a fight. Instead, he would . . . https://t.co/rVZQratIu5
===
@GailSimone I voted for Fife, but Barney is the end boss.
===
@GailSimone He's not a dinosaur... they always win
===
@DCrapuchettes I'm not that familiar with the game itself but is the question on the box based on a card in the game? I'd stick with that concept but pull a shortlist of cards and see if there was anything that felt right from within it.
===
@huntressofhappy Really good question. These days a fair amount of my collection is because I'm a board game product photographer, and so I keep the games I shoot. 

I hosted a weekly game night at my house so was actually pretty good at working through my collection, these days, less so!
===
@BirdwoodGames Bought them a few years ago on Wayfair, they only had 3 in stock and although lots of folks have asked about them since no one seems to have found them again.

Fife is a poser, so it's really down to the Dinosaur and Rubble, both of whom have disturbing giggles that remind one of Richard Widmark in "Kiss of Death."   Going with Rubble, due to so much evidence that he can subdue dinosaurs. https://t.co/cUUpBY5HVT
===
@KalelData @GailSimone oh we're looking in the Barney bag, what shall we make today? with imagination and the Barney bag, we'll beat the other Barneys flat, yeah! we'll beat them Barneys up today.
===
@GailSimone No Barney Stinson?
===
@GailSimone Barney Rubble as the Kurgan, voiced by Clancy Brown.
===
@GailSimone Fife is a stone cold killer. So much so he is only allowed to carry a single bullet lest he take crime to the bank. The blood bank.
===
@GailSimone They only give him one bullet because that‚Äôs all he needs.
===
Cleaning up my kids LEGOs, and I think I accidentally created the coolest Robin in the Multiverse? What say you @TheReadPile @GailSimone @scottmenville https://t.co/7Va9yxTOZh
===
@GailSimone Barney the Dinosaur eats Barney Rubble and Barney Fife puts him down since he's a dangerous animal.
===
@GailSimone People never asked why Fife only had that one bullet. Maybe he didn't even need it...
===
@GailSimone They definitely forgot that of the three, he's the only one who carries a gun.
===
@GailSimone Also he has access to firearms.
===
@sensational_gus @GailSimone Solid tweet.
===
@GailSimone Yea but like a kids TV stuffie actors, Barney the Dino is in real life is cold, calculating, and has years of pent up rage. He'll massacre you, then will sing a song about loving yourself outta spite as he watches you bleed out.... https://t.co/JjfRtJUy28
===
@GailSimone And his "bones like chicken"?
===
@GailSimone Doesn't Barney Fife have the same mutant luck power as Domino, so that despite his bumbling,  he'll win in the end?
===
@GailSimone Stinson. Barney Stinson easily wins this fight.
===
@GailSimone No way Barney rubble would break a sweat against a real dinosaur much less a plush one
===
@GailSimone Barney Fife may only have one bullet, but that's one more than the other two have.
===
@JYuter @GailSimone And unlike Fife, Miller gets as many bullets as he wants.
===
@GailSimone Fife is a bumbler. The Dinosaur doesn‚Äôt have the heart. Barney Rubble is cheerful and kind, but he‚Äôs as hard as the stone he breaks everyday.
===
@GailSimone Greenway https://t.co/ZYfSbI7Ysn
===
@GailSimone It's not, but a hot dog gordita sounds like a brilliant idea.
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôm guessing Rubble isn‚Äôt afraid to play dirty. :D
===
@GailSimone Does Rubble get to tag team in Pebbles or Bam-Bam?
===
@GailSimone Fife. He has a gun. 
Dinosaur is just a human in a smelly suit. Guy will pass out from heat exaustion before the fight starts. 
Rubble will be so focused on being stuck in his past*, Fife can easily get him. 

Remember Flinsyones takes place in Jetsons future. https://t.co/jTynXoPQUe
===
@GailSimone Why is the Dinosaur winning? He may be big, but he has zero fighting spirit. The man will not last a round.
===
@GailSimone Is it the Barney Rubble from the recent comic? Because he has seen some shit in combat
===
Barney Fife would win big time. https://t.co/GsSyPZygwA https://t.co/vo6zGshz6W
===
@GailSimone Well let‚Äôs see. Rubble has already tamed the dinosaurs to serve as his appliances, so the Dinosaur‚Äôs just a glorified lawnmower to him. Which means it‚Äôs between Rubble and Fife. Rubble is a caveman, which gives him the physical advantage. Gotta go with Rubble
===
@GailSimone But barney the dinosaurs jaw muscles look hench, bet he could chew through steel
===
@GailSimone And he's got abs of steel.. https://t.co/DQvILKtWli
===
@GailSimone Barney Rubble literally keeps dinosaurs as pets, so...
===
@GailSimone How is the Dinosaur winning? Barney Rubble comes from a race of cavemen that enslaved dinos. You think he can‚Äôt handle a purple T Rex with no sharp teeth that‚Äôs not even bigger than the average adult human?
===
@GailSimone I guess you could say..... *sunglasses*

Your word is your Bond?

/yeeaaaaauuhhh!

//Ow, I gave myself a *crinjury* with that groaner.
===
@GailSimone Strike her down.

She will become more powerful than they can possibly imagine.

/I hope that's not damning with faint praise.
//Given her persecutors' crudely limited imaginations.
===
@GailSimone They clearly forgot about the innate lizard taming of Bedrock residents and raw physical power of a cartoon caveman. And Barney Rubble has a child called Bam Bam.
===
@GailSimone Did people forget the dinosaur is just a person in a foam suit?
===
@GailSimone I mean... He‚Äôs a Dino who stranglehold‚Äôs... I mean ‚Äúhugs‚Äù right?
===
@GailSimone Rubble has to spar with Bambam
===
@Nick_Wild1Ear One more thing though. You really should follow @GailSimone. She is a lovely person and would hate for anyone to have piled on you.
Just don't take any of her troll-y posts too seriously =)
===
@GailSimone Dinosaurs have sharp pointy teeth though
===
@opalpeaches @NFComicCon @RocketSpouse @GailSimone What my sister said! ^_^
===
@GailSimone I dunno. I think these times call for kaiju-taint jokes.
===
@GailSimone The dinosaur has access to the raw, limitless imagination of children, making what they picture reality.
===
@GailSimone @NFComicCon @opalpeaches @RocketSpouse And I'll never feeling honored to be so! ^_^

@RobyEdmo @GailSimone Barney the dinosaur is a kind oaf by choice 

He‚Äôs a vicious bloodthirsty T-Rex by nature 

He chooses to be kind but he has definitely committed atleast one murder
===
@EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Barney Fife is a cop tho so he‚Äôs probably committed atleast one police brutality
===
@GailSimone Cavemen killed the dinosaur, and modern man killed the cave man. Fife, all the way.
===
Love it! https://t.co/Xe8pCwewRi
===
@GailSimone Barney The Dinosaur really is a psychopath when you get down to it.
===
@GailSimone Obviously the dinosaur because... https://t.co/q2c2MlxMFM
===
@GailSimone Love wins.
===
@GailSimone Barney the Dinosaur wins on accident, tripping over his ginormous clown feet and crushing the other too into jelly. The incident haunts him so badly now he can only smile hollowly and vapidly sing children's songs in order to sooth his constant anguish
===
@EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone *looks to camera*
"E-huh-huh-huh-huh! Watch me trick these other two Barney's into the elaborate death trap so there can be only one, e-huh-huh-huh-huh!"
===
Zatanna of course! https://t.co/kn9ViPFd0U
===
@HenryCrabgrass @GailSimone I'm sad that Fife is so behind... He would win just out of there luck.
===
@GailSimone Rubble. I mean he got a whole cockney term named after him
===
@GailSimone Gonna go with Rubble. He might seem like a nice guy, but he's hard as a rock and knows how to use a mallet. Barney the dinosaur would be very confused as to why you want to fight and sing a song about empathy. Fife is a lover, not a fighter. So it has to be rubble
===
@GailSimone Barney Rubble can talk to animals and has a freakishly strong child. You can't lose with that team behind you. https://t.co/ql371JaHjv
===
@GailSimone Barney Goldwater, obviously.
===
@GailSimone Wait for it.
===
@GailSimone Are Barney Gumble and Barney Miller not allowed to play?  Oh well, My money's on Fife.  He can use that bullet for the dinosaur.  Barney Rubble gets distracted by children's cereal and Fife takes him out after that.
===
@GailSimone But what about the most important Barney? https://t.co/onYjNGOSth
===
@Raize_12 @GailSimone I just... she doesn't have a responsibility to respond to this unless there are plentyof people who actually believe her tweet. Scroll through her feed and expose your heart as you read. It's more helpful than standing up for something nobody is attacking.
===
@GailSimone Fife, of course.  Only one bullet in the gun but it'll suffice against the others.
===
@GailSimone Barney Miller.
===
@GailSimone Barney Fife all the way

Doesn't even need a bullet in his gun to take em down https://t.co/N2wFnLecw7
===
@GailSimone Fife has a gun, but he's an idiot. If Rubble went full caveman, or even just like threw a bowling ball he could win.
===
@GailSimone We all know it's Barney Barton the Dinosaur that's winning in a fight. He's a former Hawkeye, and he can't live with the same that someone not only saw him in a dino costume but someone beat him in a fight when he's in a dino costume. https://t.co/pjIf4ZpmSK
===
@GailSimone Um, there is no way on God‚Äôs green earth that DON KNOTTS loses a fist fight to anyone. I saw the man take down bootleggers without a bullet in his gun. https://t.co/zrSGOUKZRk
===
@GailSimone Rubble,  but accidentally.
===
@GailSimone You're gonna want to play Marvel Villainous separately at first to get a feel for it. It's POSSIBLE to merge them, but the Fate Deck mechanics and event system make it a very different monster.
===
@GailSimone There's also Barney Gumble!
===
@GailSimone I love you, you love me...

We‚Äôre a happy family

*so don‚Äôt you f*** with us*
===
@JYuter @GailSimone With that opening theme song, how could he lose?
===
@GailSimone Yyyeeeeeeeeaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh.
===
@MrDanielJKing @GailSimone I was going to say something like ‚Äúthanks for making me feel old‚Äù - but you get a pass for being from NZ. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôm reminded daily how much I hate some of the people in this country.
===
@GailSimone Does Barney Rubble have time to plan?
===
@GailSimone Fife has one bullet, probably freaks out when he sees Barney The Dinosaur and blasts him, leaving him alone against Rubble, who pounds him into wet gravel.
===
@GailSimone Rubble. He got that caveman strength.
===
@GailSimone Depends.  Does the dinosaur have all the infinity stones yet? https://t.co/0fZEbTCinc
===
@GailSimone Stinson . . . wait for it . . . by a mile.
===
@GailSimone Rubble is the most physically capable 

Fife has a gun but is not going to be good with it. 

The Dinosaur wields magic but only to conjure bags full of cardboard tubes and shit like that. He would be quickly enslaved by a member of Flintstones society.
===
@TheSaneWhitaker @GailSimone If he uses his one bullet, he'll aim for the dinosaur who may not die from it. Then he'll be helpless
===
@GailSimone Rubble. He lives a daily life of subjugating dinosaurs.
===
@GailSimone Literally never heard of the other two but voting Barney The Dinosaur anyway
===
@GailSimone Barney the Dinosaur lacks heart
===
@GailSimone Rubble, who wears the Dinosaur's skin as a warning to Fife.
===
@GailSimone Fife is losing, he would have to ask Andy for more bullets
===
@GailSimone Disney said you can have one Blafk Cauldron today!! I'm so happy to see it getting something
===
@GailSimone IS THAT THE BLACK CAULDRON!?!
===
@GailSimone Barney Fife has a gun.

@GailSimone Barney the Dinosaur has an anger management problem. He got hands. https://t.co/kXp0XgH6Yi

@GailSimone The dinosaur has emotional issues he releases in weekly boxing lessons. He was not part of the "happy family" like they said...
===
@GailSimone Barney Greenway, singer for Napalm Death

@GailSimone in Britain one of these three has a name that literally MEANS fight
===
@GailSimone Gumble?!
===
@joshadams @GailSimone Hey Josh! Miss you too, pal!
===
@GailSimone I miss seeing you at Cons!
===
@GailSimone Fries bun, and the hot dog is chopped up, so yeah
===
You were the first creator I ever met at my first con...and I embarrassed myself by thinking you were the artist instead of the writer.

I apologized the next time I saw you (both times at ECCC); you were kind and gracious and forgiving and wonderful. #IMetGail https://t.co/0cJjTjT5fb
===
@Cam6363 @virtua_sloth @GailSimone She opposed the bill and wanted to be at the signing.
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at ECCC 2019 :) at her exhibitors hall table. We talked for a brief moment because there were a lot of people in line but I was able to gift her some small copies of my comic. She‚Äôs awesome and very inspiring.
===
@gaelankelly @GailSimone I miss the Jim Lee X-Men.

This is so ugly! https://t.co/xx7kWsWV47

@GailSimone I‚Äôm just curious , do you play d&amp;d and if so what  is your go to class?
===
@RazorwireRyan @mattzollerseitz @Maximumrider217 Sounds like @GailSimone chit chat over here.
===
@GailSimone One daaaaayüò≠
===
@GailSimone I didn't so much meet you, as almost go up to you then scurry away.
===
@GailSimone I haven't but I think your nice
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôve met you several times at ECCC, but the most important was in 2019, my first year out as a trans woman. Before the con, you tweeted the nicest supportive message to me, so I made sure you were the first person I came up to, to thank you. #IMetGail
===
@GailSimone It meant a lot to me! üíö
===
@GailSimone What is "something white people ask at a mexican restaraunt"?
===
@GailSimone This is even worse than it seems. 

For obvious reasons, State Reps are exempt from the usual "misdemeanor obstruction" that people can be charged with if they interrupt legislative proceedings.

In order to justify the arrest, Rep. Cannon had to be charged with a felony.
===
@GailSimone If the felony is overturned (which it very likely will be), it means the arrest is blatantly unconstitutional. 

Rep. Cannon's civil rights are being violated on camera by police under orders from the governor, and most likely nothing will be done about it.

@easz_hostile @ncreson @le_canuck @GailSimone Bvs didn‚Äôt suck because it ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt do what you want‚Äô. It objectively sucked. In many of the same ways justice league sucked. Yes, the Snyder cut is a bad movie.
===
@easz_hostile @ncreson @le_canuck @GailSimone Look I get it, you like Batman. I do too. Zack Snyder is not Batman. He sucks.
===
@Heathen_bird @GailSimone These pretzels are making me thirsty

@GarryGourlay @GailSimone From what my half century has taught me, never underestimate children. They‚Äôre far smarter then you think.

It‚Äôs almost 10pm  

I‚Äôm awaiting Gail for appropriate outrage.  @GailSimone
===
@GarryGourlay @GailSimone Sometimes underperforming isn‚Äôt because the child isn‚Äôt smart. Not saying that‚Äôs your case. It was mine as a sevenish year old.

@GarryGourlay @GailSimone Dangit. Now I noticed that today has been ok outside of Georgia and Missouri.
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at Fan Expo Dallas back in 2017.  You were very gracious and signed about 12 of my promo posters as I fumbled to get them out of their envelopes. I‚Äôd still LOVE to schedule a time to have you on my show! https://t.co/CqnNLPgmHA
===
@GailSimone I've yet to meet you, but maybe at a con one day. When we can start holding them again, that is. üòÅ

@GailSimone @threedomusa Threedom's relationship with Gail reminds me of Noel Fielding's Luxury comedy where the only fan (Terry) was a main character.

At the least I am most happy that we got to see Snyder's vision and that he got to fulfill his own. 
#JusticeLeagueSnyderCut #SnyderCutJusticeLeague #SnyderCut #ZackSnyderJusticeLeague #DCEU #DC #WB #Darkseid #Batfleck #WonderWoman #Aquaman #Cyborg #Flash  #ZackSnyder
===
Let's hope they continue it and we get to witness this epic vision of Zack Snyder and see both flash and cyborg have standalone movies and hope that batfleck is let down easy ( if he is ) and let's hope we get Cavill back as The Man Of Steel.
===
And just scrapping both a justice league and a suicide squad is just worse.
 If u don't want to continue them why make those movies? 

Let's hope we get a good show runner and that the direction they take the DCEU is the right one (the darker one).
===
And the climax. WHOOAA!!

But since it's not going to be continued, it feels sad and Snyder is right in saying that he doesn't want to associate with WB anymore, because they dint respect him enough as a person let alone a filmmaker.
===
And not to mention the bad moustache face of superman in the josstice league  and the amazing score in the Snyder cut. 
#RestoretheSnyderVerese #RestoreTheSnyderVerse #restorethesynderverse
===
Let's talk about the Snyder cut for a moment.
It was 100 times better than josstice league, both in terms of direction and character development and a better realized villain with an actual purpose and thankfully not the parademons, they feed on fear so you are dead Steppenwolf. https://t.co/bgrfJRhnkG
===
Let's hope for a darker dc and an epic battle with Darkseid.

But the way DC has handled things is the worst they could do. Firstly, they dint have a vision / planning to make a series of films and secondly, they dint let a man who had a vision bring it on screen / continue it.
===
@ABC Just spotted: @GailSimone in the raw.

@GailSimone @threedomusa Well, you see, when two men and a woman love each other...
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail
I met you at Dragon*Con. I had a few BoP and Batgirl issues signed. I was a bit shy, and you were so gracious.
===
@GailSimone I never gave it a chance. It was filmed in Louisiana, but takes place in a Victorian home. The real Grand Isle is a bunch of fishing camps on wood pilings and there‚Äôs only one road in or out. My family owned a camp for many years, but it was destroyed during Katrina. https://t.co/rj9ykiRe8C

@moregamespls I have a sudden urge to come over and mess things up just a bit. You are WAY too tidy.

@GailSimone I'm a nerd that's never been to a con. Was going to go to my first one when the pandemic hit and that's all she wrote. Bloody apocalypse.

@GailSimone #IMetGail in 2017 at Megacon Orlando. You signed your story in the Love Is Love anthology for me. I forgot to ask if you would take a picture with me which I kicked myself about later. You were really nice,, then I walked away figuring you thought I was a big spaz lol

@GailSimone Cause its a question ive waited to say but never knew if its cool!

@GailSimone Looks tasty

@GailSimone #IMetGail at a convention once, briefly. Maybe Drew Edwards was there? It would've been the mid-2000s, either in NY or Philly probably + I can't imagine making any impression whatsoever, but I was told that both Gail and husband were nice people + then I immediately had to... go?

@TheNotoriousRBF @GailSimone Gordita means "Chubby" in spanish but is a female word. The male word is gordito I guess (I don't really speak Spanish. We call it "portunhol" half portuguese and half spanish). In portuguese the word for chubby is "gordinha". But...What should mean gordita in english?

@GailSimone (In reality this friend would've totally understood of the line was too long to get things signed). You went to another booth for a Tomb Raider signing, so I went over and was able to actually meet you (no line there, bought a copy of TR to get signed haha)
===
@GailSimone You were so nice and understanding, and told me to meet up with Rocket Spouse at your booth when you got back there later to pick up my script. One of the best, if not the best celebrity interactions I've had at a con, and I've been a follower ever since!
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at C2E2 back in college, probably 2014 or 2015. My friends gave me their Secret Six book to get signed and I bought them a script you were selling. I got super anxious because the line was to see you was hours long and I thought I had screwed up royally for this friend
===
@GailSimone It probably wasn't memorable for you, it was one of thousands of people you interacted with, but I so distinctly remember being distraught before meeting you, then elated at you and your husband's kindness and understanding. It saved my day and still brings a smile to my face

#IMetGail at MegaCon in Orlando in 2016. She asked what characters I liked; I told her I‚Äôd given up following characters or companies and just followed writers and artists I liked from book to book. Like, say, @GailSimone . @RocketSpouse was kind enough to shoot a pic. https://t.co/wc6jEpa7eq

@RolfMaul @GailSimone I used to do that- little me frequently said ‚Äúmunchings and crunching, my precious‚Äù as a wee one. (I was 6 when the first LotR movie came out so I always just mashed them)
===
@maestromorte @GailSimone The book were some of my favourites growing up and I was obsessed with Eilonwy and I had NOBODY To share it with. (I still maintain that if the movie had come out a decade or so later, it would have resonated a lot better with audiences)
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at Rose City Comicon. We talked about greyhounds, hate crimes, and Safari Pearl in Moscow Idaho. Rocket Spouse said I was the most interesting person to stop by your table that day. That made me feel like a cool kid.
===
@GailSimone I met you at Fan Days in Dallas. I was very nervous because I'm kind of socially awkward, and I had a Wonder Woman print I gave you while stammering how much I love your work. Also talked to @RocketSpouse about Ren Fairs, he was delightful #IMetGail
===
@GailSimone If by narc you mean Neat, Awesome, Rad, Cool...then yes. Yes, he is Gail.

@GailSimone Paging @MythicalChef
===
@MythicalChef @GailSimone Thank you sir, also, I was unaware of that level of detail in which Taco Bell got their influence.
===
@gwynerso @maestromorte @GailSimone I love the books.   They were among the first ones I ever bought for myself when I was a kid.

I absolutely hate that Disneyfied mess of a movie though.
===
Wife and I have all of the expansions (including Marvel version) and I can confirm this is a great game! https://t.co/SiejoTTNz3

@GailSimone Buenos Aires, 2017 at a signing in a comicbook store. Your husband took a picture of us with my Barbie Diana. #IMetGail https://t.co/tH2S0Tv4YU

@esteetabernac @GailSimone And in South Africa: mielie meal
===
@GailSimone Met you and your husband at Comic-Con! You guys were a delight!
===
@GailSimone The magic of the porch!
===
@GailSimone How does this magic work?
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at a Dallas comic book store in the mid-2000s. She was amazing but I was a mess of silly anxiety about what stories I was going to thank her for, and I think I actually ended up bouncing after a handshake.
ü§£ü•∞üòé(Yes, most of it was Birds of Prey related) üñ§üíôüíú

We‚Äôve met at two Rose City Comic Cons üåπ https://t.co/Vq1P2hwegG

@GailSimone He really is.

@popcultscribe @GailSimone Followed by ‚ÄúCyclops heat rays!‚Äù???
ü§£ü§£ü§£
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at Rose City Comic Con in the Before Times (2019). I awkwardly introduced myself as the slayer of Farkas, and I bought the Escaping Megalopolis book, which she graciously signed. We recorded a happy birthday video for @tropicalsteve.
===
@GailSimone @tropicalsteve also! tangent for anyone listening who has the power to make it happen, I want more Megalopolis.
===
@GailSimone @travelingmanuk It is travelling man!
===
@GailSimone #imetgail about 7/8 years ago now in York. You were the first person from any sort of media that I enjoyed that I had gone out of my way to visit; I had no idea that you could just meet people who make stuff. I remember you saying how strange it is that we eat beans for breakfast https://t.co/6YprGH0wr9
===
@GailSimone Cobble muffies
===
@GailSimone Yes I was. That was the last cosplay I put together. You and Rocketspouse were so gracious and lovely and if you're ever backup my way I believe I owe you a home cooked meal. üíú
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at Edmonton Expo (Canada) in... 2016? Dressed as gender-swapped CatMan. Got some things signed for other people. Still have the mask hanging on my wall. https://t.co/nnHuFoYTAs
===
@GailSimone Okay but I WANT to cook you a meal. I miss you lots and lots. Thank you for being you.
===
@GailSimone I had the pleasure to meet you and @RocketSpouse in Mexico City at La Mole 2015. You were really kind and signed me a bunch of comics üòä as I was leaving your booth you mentioned that you really liked the Batgirl tshirt I was wearing. Since then I've been following you in Twitter
===
@GailSimone I misread that as beer and got excited
===
@GailSimone Despite my tl ramblings, I almost gave up writing last year. Then I remembered I wanted to COMPLETE something and have you see it.

You've done more good than harm, ma'am. Thank you.

Also, Gambit looks like he smells of oyster sauce and cat poop.
===
@GailSimone I met @gailsimone at Megacon 2013 in Orlando, FL. She signed some issues I had of Batgirl New 52 and Birds of Prey. She was so nice! And a made a doodle of herself on my autograph book!
===
@GailSimone This is how Gail's followers can find each other at conventions. While standing in a line or sitting in a panel, just casually ask people in the vicinity, "You guys know Gambit is a narc?"
===
@GailSimone He joined the cops despite being the aon of thieves
Class traitor
===
@GailSimone I knew he bogarted, but he's a narc?
===
@GailSimone Oh, I know.
Trust me, I know.
===
@TJoyceChin @GailSimone üòÇ this is the correct answer.
===
#IMetGail  at Skull Island Con, where she was engaged in targeted harassment on a Mr. Jack Driscoll during a snake pit fight that followed the costume contest, in which she entered dressed as "Gail Simone" and destroyed the buffet. Best birthday ever! https://t.co/3n1Y9oQouZ
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at a Glasgow Comic Con in the CCA back in 2014. Thought I was over getting tongue tied meeting authors but nope, Gail got me completely in nervous knots!
===
@GailSimone Narcoholic Narctropolous of the upper Narcton Narcs, in fact miss gail
===
@GailSimone I did!!! https://t.co/lVcXzgSUr3
===
@GailSimone It could. You and your friends/colleagues comics and social media presence is what‚Äôs gotten me through the last five/six years. Particularly last year.
===
#IMetGail at SDCC, and she signed my entire Secret Six run. I don't actually remember much, because I was geeking the actual fuck out that I was meeting the woman who's witty run got me into comics 1/2 https://t.co/wpjeaZdas0
===
I do remember her asking me which member is my favorite, and my mind going blank and stuttering out a name(I'm pretty sure it was the wrong one, too)
So to  FINALLY answer the question @GailSimone , it's your Bane, with Ragdoll in close second. #IMetGail
===
@GailSimone Was it because you asked for I.C. Weiner?
===
@genericblues @GailSimone That was awesome
===
I learned you would be in Asheville the next day, and quickly made plans to drive down. It was my (and Alex's!) first con. 
We brought you Zombie Dice.

#IMetGail https://t.co/3W8XczR9Dj https://t.co/Sm6AIDEN3R
===
@GailSimone Meet a couple times at #ECCC. I had the chance to buy some scripts last time, but every time I've had lovely conversations with your S.O. #IMetGail
===
@GailSimone Bears are known for being very funny on the internet.
===
#ImetGail at New York Comic-Con in the early 2010s. She signed an issue of Batgirl and I think Birds of Prey for me. https://t.co/UB655ol8n9
===
@GailSimone Coin.
===
@GailSimone I will forever think of Gambit as "the defendant"
===
@GailSimone And your compliment still means the world to me. Thank you üíôüíú
===
I met Gail Simone at SDCC 2016, where she was promoting Crosswind at the Image booth

We talked, she signed a poster (I still have it), and  posed for a pic. I was cosplaying, so she asked if I wanted to take off my mask for the pic, but I said ‚Äúno I‚Äôm ugly‚Äù lol

1/2

#IMetGail https://t.co/SmVaHEswk7
===
#IMetGail at SDCC 2018 just as a fan in 2012? Then I was a panelist at NYCC in 2019 and I saw you in the hotel restaurant and I was like, "KEEP IT COOL, BALLANTYNE" https://t.co/LlvijDmuUW
===
@GailSimone Gotta see you again so we can show you our matching Secret Six tattoos in person!
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail twice: once for FCBD in Manchester NH on my wife's birthday and we spent hours hanging out, talking with Rocket Spouse when Gail had a line.
The following Boston Comic Con, we saw them again and Rebecca gifted them with custom Catman shirts.
===
@edubalbino @GailSimone I mean... this is what it means in Spanish... ? Did I just ruin a bit, or did I deliver relevant information? It's hard to tell here.
===
@edubalbino @GailSimone The fun thing about English is that it freely accepts words from other languages without any concern for linguistic purity. So "gordita" in English currently means... a gordita. As in the Mexican stuffed sandwich-like food. Or some more Americanized adaptation of it.
===
@edubalbino @GailSimone I always thought it was called that because the sandwich is small and fat. But I don't know for sure.
===
@GailSimone Poppycock?
===
@Bentotron @GailSimone I believe that Taco Bell's gorditas were inspired by Durango-style gorditas, which are typically made with masa harina. However, the way Taco Bell prepares them is more similar to a taco arabe. I am certain they are not hot dogs.
===
Gail always knows exactly what to say. https://t.co/jbEmi2lQIc
===
#IMetGail at C2E2 2020 and I talked to her husband about pickles while waiting in line for autographs. Also she really had to pee and I was the last in line. https://t.co/tveDM75wKU
===
@GailSimone I met you at @MegaConOrlando back in 2017. (It‚Äôs generic and you get it all the time) told you I loved your work and you thanked me for being a fan. Thanks again for being so cool
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at @thirdeyecomics for free comic book day in 2013 I believe The movement had just started to come out and I was really enjoying it and had read some #birdsofprey at that point
===
@GailSimone Oh, man!  We are huge Smash Up fans!  I personally love the fairy tale expansion and the one that has vampires, but... they are all so good!
===
@SusanWojcicki @brielarson @realamberheard @GailSimone Tomorrow the Quartering gets a special phone call with @TeamYouTube  about him being harassed. Make sure you ask him about the Mass downvoting campaigns &amp; why he EJOYS mean comments on channels. When he is üò•to you for things THEY do. https://t.co/kKAmimVfD8
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail twice! Once at a signing at the downtown Midtown Comics and once at NYCC ‚öîÔ∏è https://t.co/BjP2d3GwQr
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail We've met a couple of times at ECCC, you really liked my friend's @pinkevilbob  Mary Marvel costume the first time we met, and she gave you a toy shark because we loved King Shark in Secret Six. You actually recognized and remembered us the next year we went as well!
===
@GailSimone, I wish you could run a course on how to be a totally fantastic creative person celebrity on social media. You bring a lot of light and fun into a very dark world, and I think others could learn from you. I'm grateful for your joy.
===
@GailSimone just wondering if you‚Äôll be making any appearances at our little con in Akron Ohio? Or our even smaller one in Cuyahoga falls?
===
A true #IMetGail story:
Back in 2016 @c2e2, Gail, @RocketSpouse &amp; I had a funny moment. All of us are teetotal, but while asking Gail about hair care at a con, I recommended using beer as a conditioner. Rocket's eyes grew as wide as @LenWein's &amp; Gail recommended that I use... https://t.co/QuxFqG3saw https://t.co/EBhQJudtdT
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at London Film and Comic Con. It was the one that's infamous for being really stupidly hot.

We didn't speak for long, but you signed my issue #1 of The Movement. And my memory for conversations is terrible, but you were super nice. https://t.co/QIASP94TJ9
===
Yes! The combination opportunities are nearly ENDLESS with Smash Up. A Spider-Verse and Fairy Princesses union might become one we try...üï∏Ô∏èüßö https://t.co/uoho9s3dBt
===
@GailSimone @alderac That was perfect! üëå
===
@GailSimone we‚Äôre so happy to know you had a great time! Now the question is did your team win? üòÉ https://t.co/4yFwt5Zhwm

That moment when your game gets a first class review from @GailSimone! https://t.co/uvcRYVmsY8
===
@GailSimone Awesome! Which factions did you end up enjoying the most?
===
So cool to see Smash Up: Marvel on @GailSimone's tabletop. We can't wait to find out what she'll play next! https://t.co/qDs3uWcUB7
===
@GailSimone We bet you‚Äôve got the next one! https://t.co/pady3NdHKC
===
@NeedhamComics @GailSimone @RavensburgerNA It's a shuffling building card game in which players combine two Marvel-themed factions and battle other players' factions for control of Bases. You can also find more info here: https://t.co/VAR3srOZi2
===
@GailSimone I believe I met you at Rose City Comic Con.  At least one
===
@GailSimone is making me want to buy Villainous now. BTWs, Amazon has the main game, the Marvel, and an expansion buy 2 get 1 free and Target has the main game and several expansions for the same.. but I'll never play so why spend the money?
===
@MollieHasWords @GailSimone if it HELPS, Target has the main game and the Scar expansion buy 2 get 1 free (and most of the others too). Amazon does too, but you'd have to get the Marvel version to get the full benefit.
===
@GailSimone Really everyone.. Target has Villanous and expansions buy 2 get 1 free. Amazon has a few as well, but a much smaller selection for buy 2 get 1

Fantastic thread from @GailSimone looking at Smash Up Marvel from @TheOpGames and @alderac! This game is a blast and was such a fun one to work on with both teams. 

There are so many cool combinations too. Really need to get this on the table with more Smash Up expansions! https://t.co/cFtbRSTGdu
===
@GailSimone Wait, the Black Cauldron!?! I love that book and movie, I feel like it gets forgotten all the time. Yay!
===
@GailSimone Dallas Fan Expo, 2017. I was there with @JeremyMegertArt selling our comic book, and our table wasn‚Äôt too far from yours. You signed my Batgirl tattoo and I ran over to get it inked immediately. It was awesome #IMetGail https://t.co/5wzcpMoXno

@GailSimone Can you please retweet this https://t.co/ukZWtyyNZy

@GailSimone Some days https://t.co/1BBPUJNjtX

@GailSimone You pulled me out of that foxhole, battered and scared in Vietnam. #neverforget

@GailSimone Have a good time or win?

@GailSimone @RavensburgerNA It's a beautiful game, isn't it?! Gotta tag @NJekich in my reply though. She will know why...
===
@GailSimone I got you to sign The Simpsons comic collection I have which featured your first published comic

@GailSimone #IMetGail at SwanCon in Australia in 2013
===
@GailSimone @JamesGunn @idriselba @MargotRobbie @JohnCena @joelkinnaman @Dastmalchian @AliceBraga @NathanFillion @Thejudgegunn @flula @MissNgInAction agree very star wars meets old western
===
@GailSimone Although in Argentina it refers to a slender young woman.
===
@GailSimone Nah, it's a chubby baby girl.üòÉ
===
@GailSimone @travelingmanuk That does it. I'm cutting my bangs.
===
@moregamespls Do you play everything that you own more than once? My mind is boggled by how many games you have.
===
@GailSimone @RocketSpouse @JoCoCruise So I screw up my courage, drag hubby over, &amp; introduce myself (and him). Voice shaky and the crying already starting I manage to stutter out how I'm usually a soggy mess when faced with her, but that I wanted to let her know how much her work has meant to me.
===
@GailSimone @RocketSpouse It was an emotional memory of meeting you and also not being able to hold an intelligent conversation with you, leaving me elated and humiliated, but when you were going to be at Emerald City the next year or so, I had a chance to redeem myself!
===
@GailSimone @RocketSpouse @JoCoCruise I cried but didn't sob. I shook but didn't pass out. I told her about the other times I'd met her &amp; was a soggy mess but knew she wouldn't remember 1 amicably deranged fan amongst all the cons she did, but I was happy to meet her successfully, FINALLY, &amp; appreciated her time.
===
@GailSimone Dammit, Gail, now I'm crying again!
===
@GailSimone I'd been a big fan since the blog days, &amp; was over the moon you'd written Batgirl as she became my patronus in grad school for my library degree. I was trying to tell you how much it meant to read such a feminist, powerful, flawed character, but all that came out was ugly sobs.
===
@gwynerso @RolfMaul @GailSimone The Prydain books were my first intro to fantasy as a kid! Also, I'm not sure what made me connect Gurgi and Grover in my head, but they are inextricably entwined.
===
@GailSimone @RocketSpouse I took another comic, saw you at the signing table, slid the comic to you, and promptly lost my shit all over again. Again my now-husband interpreted, and I scurried away sobbing, resigned that this is just how I act when #IMetGail But there's more.
===
@GailSimone I mean UGLY sobs. Like great, heaving, juicy, can't-understand-a-word-I'm-saying sobs. My partner was interpreting, and you and @rocketspouse were so kind. You signed my book with this: https://t.co/PGOqcfHoJu
===
@GailSimone @RocketSpouse @JoCoCruise Then... she hugged me. &amp; made me feel at ease and not like an (amicably) deranged fan &amp; chatted with me &amp; @kccmpbl for several minutes as we all waited for the concert to start. &amp; what was a humiliating memory became a great story that brings me joy to tell about how #IMetGail
===
@GailSimone @RocketSpouse Fast forward 2 years, &amp; we're very excited for our 2017 @JoCoCruise! Hubby asks in passing, "did you see who they just added?" Nope. He says, "Gail Simone" &amp; my literal response was, "Fuck." Boat is very small; how will I avoid sobbing on the salad bar when she walks by?!?
===
@GailSimone @RocketSpouse @JoCoCruise Boat time comes, we get on boat, manage to only see Gail at big-stage events &amp; not make eye contact all other times. Then comes the land concert in Loreto. She and Rocket Spouse are lounging, waiting for the concert to start, &amp; I decide 3rd time is the charm.
===
@GailSimone This'll take more than 1 tweet. #IMetGail at Rose City Comic Con in (I think) 2013. I'd missed you at the signing table &amp; my fianc√© convinced me to poke my head in the room where you'd shortly have a panel to see if you'd sign my hardback Batgirl: The Darkest Reflection.
===
@GailSimone Oh, I'm sure there's another magic front just off shore! https://t.co/Ql1xVNs6w7
===
@GailSimone Gail. I got one, and it's pretty dang great. https://t.co/ZhLuMjE6f9
===
@GailSimone The Grateful Dead played that song once.  Apparently some of us did not appreciate the irony.
===
@GailSimone Have #IMetGail yet? Well, no. But I should go search for a Yogi Bear shirt I could wear if I where to attend a con she where appearing at... https://t.co/HS4wkwoJgS
===
@GailSimone I love Ursula so much but she is *rough* to play in Villainous.
===
@GailSimone It's a really complicated path to get to her win condition that also relies on some significant draw-luck. She's very interesting to play, but it's a slow build and other villains can get to the win much faster. Keep your fates handy!
===
@GailSimone We met nearly a decade ago, briefly, at NYCC--my wife and I mentioned talking about your work together on our first date, and how we'd been married for a few years! (Ten years later, and we're still going strong. &lt;3) #IMetGail
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôve been wanting the pack with Scar because he‚Äôs been my favorite Disney character since I was 2... this glowing review might push me to buy...
===
@GailSimone a LONG long time ago in a place called Australia... a convention called Supanova... a green room somewhere.
===
@GailSimone ‚ù§Ô∏è The Black Cauldron, a rare Disney animated movie with no songs.

@GailSimone I've never met you in real life but you've been to my Animal Crossing island and that was really cool.

@GailSimone In Orlando you asked about my SwampCon T-shirt #IMetGail
===
@gwynerso @GailSimone A guy got flayed alive in it, I have never STOPPED remembering it!
===
@gwynerso @GailSimone The movie is weirdly underrated, I actually read the first book of the series, and while the movie isn't exactly faithful, it's a decent abridged version.
===
@GailSimone I have seen this game before.
===
@gwynerso @GailSimone I used to have it on Book&amp;Records when i was a kid. Scared the crap out of me. I used to do the voice for Gurgi. Nobody knew who that was. Luckily Lord of the Rings came out decades later and my Gurgi impression morphed into a Golem impression.
===
@GailSimone We haven't met personally, but we did interact many years ago, back when you were writing Deadpool and Agent X. I reviewed some of your books at the time. You later gave me some words that encouraged me to do fanfic, which led eventually to my writing indie comics today. Thanks!
===
@GailSimone Oh my goodness this game looks rad by the tokens alone
===
@ABC @GailSimone enjoying some ‚Äúme‚Äù time
===
@GailSimone I met you in Boston the last time you were there and we talked about how much I loved Clean Room. I always thought meeting you would cool and you confirmed it! #IMetGail

@GailSimone #IMetGail at @FANEXPOCANADA I had her sign my Catwoman/Tweety &amp; Sylvester comic. But I‚Äôm very shy and don‚Äôt think I said anything besides thank you.

@jpalmiotti @comikazejeff @GailSimone @AmandaRantsAlot @NicolaScottArt @kehealey I met @jpalmiotti and @AmandaRantsAlot  at Megacon waiting for some hot dogs at Nathan‚Äôs.

@GailSimone Then again at SDCC 2019 when I coordinated this interview. https://t.co/ocZNMcSB6F
===
Y‚Äôall I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again Villanous is such a fun game. We‚Äôve spent HOURS on hours on this game because it‚Äôs so much fun to screw over people and play different villains. The Marvel expansion just started and it‚Äôs tons of fun as well. https://t.co/0WUoaEKw1I
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at #SDCC in 2019!
===
@GailSimone Well I never met you but my friend who owned a comic store got a call from you and didn't believe it was really you and hung up.
===
@patricklee6669 @GailSimone I'll buy it.
===
@patricklee6669 @GailSimone What happened there?
===
@patricklee6669 @GailSimone I'm joking. Jos√© may actually be an evil genius, he's just the loud idiot if the two.
===
@patricklee6669 @GailSimone To be fair one of my 7yr olds started How to Draw Comics the Marvel Way yesterday and he's great. The other ones an idiot.
===
@GailSimone Amazon says 14 so no
===
@patricklee6669 @GailSimone I can't handle this much good vibes on Twitter! If somebody doesn't call me a dick soon I'll start posting my kids comic art.
===
@patricklee6669 @GailSimone FFS I'm sorry
===
@patricklee6669 @GailSimone I've just seen what you're talking about and that's horrible and insane.
===
@GailSimone Is this good for 7yr olds?
===
@GailSimone wheres dr facilier? :(
===
@GailSimone I very much did record a game using the digital version of the game where I based the decks on Kikoskia Let's Plays and set myself versus the AI.
===
@GailSimone I may or may not have played a deck composed of the Shark and Tornado cards.
===
@GailSimone One thing I like about that game is that the win condition for the villains pretty much is the situation that occurs just prior to the climax of the movies they're part of. They just conveniently ignore the "the heroes regroup and win" section
===
@GailSimone As far as I remember, we‚Äôve just always known you guys. It‚Äôs also day 358396 of the same comic con, it just changes locations. What is time, really?
===
@GailSimone NYCC ‚Äò08, I told you Black Alice was my favorite character and you said that‚Äôs because I have great taste. ‚ö°Ô∏è#IMetGail https://t.co/rVMgBoQim3

@GailSimone #IMetGail at the only Armageddon convention to happen in Adelaide and at Supanova on the Gold Coast.
===
@GailSimone I can‚Äôt remember if it was Vancouver Fan Expo or ECCC but we‚Äôve met a couple times.
===
@GailSimone I met you at C2E2 2016 right before I moved from Chicago to California. I had a fair amount of anxiety, but gosh, you were really patient and kind to me! #IMetGail
===
@GailSimone I love Smash Up, so of course I had to add the Marvel set as soon as I saw it. I've gotten so many expansions I haven't even had the chance to try out yet, but intend to once, y'know, it's safe to be around people again.
===
@GailSimone I definitely like the Big In Japan, It's Your Fault, and Cease &amp; Desist sets, those are some of my favorites
===
@semicoop Balderdash for $1.99

Haven't taken it out to play as often as I'd like, but considering the price it's been a great deal https://t.co/mfcXNxK851
===
@ami_angelwings @GailSimone Monster of the week all the way. That's why season 1 was the best one - you had bangers like Ice, Squeeze, Ghost in the Machine, all amazing. I think they went too deep into the lore in later seasons.
===
@GailSimone not yet... though I was so shy with Uncle Walt and Aunt Weezie.. I hope I can overcome it with you
===
@dorkjrdan @GailSimone gail i thought this was real : (
===
@GailSimone No need for sorry. It wasn't a complaint. I totally get it. You were shocked/excited to see your friends. You don't owe us anything. I was happy you signed my comics
===
@GailSimone WonderCon Got 2 the front of the line just as some friends walked up 2 you. Was looking forward to some quick small chit chat with you as I got my comics signed. seemed like you hadn't seen those friends in a while and you guys were making dinner plans as you signed  #IMetGail
===
@GailSimone @TheOpGames So happy to know you like Smash up Marvel! Thanks for the comments and recommendations.  üòâ
===
@GailSimone @alderac @TheOpGames SOO fun. Lots to mix and match.
===
@jpalmiotti @comikazejeff @GailSimone @AmandaRantsAlot @kehealey I did too. I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the time I just ate your dessert without an invitation. üòä
===
@ami_angelwings @GailSimone Monster of a week, the lack of any real conclusion to the myth arc, despite multiple revival attempts, really taints the lore episodes, while the monster of the week episodes are as good as they ever were.
===
@ArcoNovellan @GailSimone I haven‚Äôt met many in my life, &amp; I‚Äôve easily met over a thousand dogs in the last 9 years. It‚Äôs really neat how they‚Äôre so graceful when they start moving, it doesn‚Äôt look like they‚Äôre moving at all. Then ZOOOOM! they‚Äôve shot across the yard like the Falcon going into hyperspace.
===
@enchanting_kcup @GailSimone You ain‚Äôt kidding! She made it all the way around the pool on several occasions before some of her Chase partners made it around two corners.

I‚Äôm not into the game myself, but you can believe Gail will have some banger news* for those of who like Magic: The Gathering.

*or it‚Äôs gonna be a major bear trap** that ensnares more people than an Onion Article.

**a trap set by a bear who‚Äôs better at trolling than everyone. https://t.co/MDVnrponQr

@moregamespls This is one of the questions in the game. Most questions don‚Äôt have an innuendo, but they can be taken is wild directions with the right group.
===
@GailSimone I LOVE SmashUp! It's a really, really fun game to play with friends! One of the few games I've ever gotten multiple expansions for! 100% worth it!
===
@GailSimone Huh. I'm amazed that the X-Men aren't a faction. Although the X-Men could probably fill 8 factions on their own.
===
@TheOpGames @GailSimone @RavensburgerNA who did the box art?
===
@GailSimone @TheOpGames @RavensburgerNA what is MARVEL SMASH-UP ?
===
@ami_angelwings @GailSimone Overall, MOTW, the mythology episodes lose steam around season 4 or 5.
===
@GailSimone Heat Vision
===
@GailSimone @alderac @TheOpGames Smash Up is one of my favourite games! Glad that you're enjoying it too (though I haven't had a chance to play the Marvel one yet)
===
@GailSimone @alderac @TheOpGames I love Smash Up so muuuuch üò©üíï
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at NYCC in 2018 (I think?). Got my precuous. Convergence: Oracle / Nightwing #1 and #2 signed and bought I think the entire run of Secret Six. Lol.  I didn‚Äôt say much ‚Äî talking is scary!  Line too long!
===
@GailSimone @TheOpGames @RavensburgerNA Smash Up is awesome. I bought the base game for my bf for Christmas.
===
@GailSimone I assumed it was the terrible nachos
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at Barcelona Comic Con 2010, you were signing with @Jock4twenty @andydiggle Ivan Reis and @GeneHa You signed me "Birds Of Prey #59" https://t.co/TfvQKbqA4v
===
@GailSimone You‚Äôd feel bad though, looking into his dumb doe eyes.
===
@GailSimone Teeth on a stick.
===
@GailSimone @alderac @TheOpGames Smash Up is so good.
===
@GailSimone Hamburger maybe
===
@GailSimone Hydra and SHIELD working together?
===
@GailSimone Sweetcorn.
===
@GailSimone @alderac @TheOpGames Ohhh, official Marvel Smash Up? I need to get me that one :D I love this game, have the Munchkin version and the cease &amp; desist expansion :)
===
@GailSimone All these #IMetGail stories are making me jealous. Someday, Simone! Someday we'll meet in glorious battle of the intoverts where we're both too shy to acknowledge each other! That's if I get the courage to get in your line, anyway.
===
@drawin_casscain @ami_angelwings @GailSimone Although as I've learnt more about UFO lore and such I have more of an appreciation for the over arcing plot of the X-Files... I'm still 100% monster of the week all the way.
===
@MelissaDeTora @GailSimone a new rowan card!
===
@GailSimone Colon cleanser
===
@GailSimone I know you play games with your partner, but I got a copy of Under Falling Skies today by @czechgames and I recommend it. Might work as a tactical discussion thing https://t.co/aAqggCdh0Z
===
@GailSimone omgggggg lol
===
@GailSimone @cloudspretty No because there‚Äôs no hot dog in it
===
@BrianWFoster @GailSimone Was really hoping it was Warner Brothers doing a parody of ‚ÄúThere Will Be Blood‚Äù with Daffy.
===
@GailSimone Saw you in person when I was camping kinda far away but still #IMetGail https://t.co/BSdcWwqn8Y
===
That is a helluva poster. https://t.co/hpWPQKOqja
===
@GailSimone Multiple weekends at @emeraldcitycon in Seattle. My wife and I gushed about Birds of Prey and you were SUPER COOL and signed a bunch of her books. Great Con and Great Guest.
Thank you!
#IMetGail
===
@GailSimone I met you at the emerald city con a couple of years ago. We chatted about Batgirl and Domino. LOVE YOUR WORK!!!!!!!

@GailSimone @Felipe_Morcelli Thanks! Ivan Reis did a nice homage to him recently:
https://t.co/xLWdpZMCKe
===
@ami_angelwings @GailSimone Now?
Monster of the week.
Before it became clear they really didn't have satisfactory answers to the biggest questions the show asked? The Lore. Nothing was quite as neat as watching the grand conspiracy against Scully, Mulder, and the world at large.
===
@GailSimone The teenagers in that song weren't up to starting a business, sounds like
===
@GailSimone No, but you can stuff a Gordita with chopped hot dogs if you wanted to.
===
@ohmorganjarrett @GailSimone @RocketSpouse Although &amp; also saw her at that C2E2 #IMetMorgan first at Derby City Comic Con.
https://t.co/oT42yCKHMX
===
@ohmorganjarrett @GailSimone @RocketSpouse Same.
That's where #IMetGail too.
===
@GailSimone Sadly, all he could see was a lone Wasteaburger...
===
@GailSimone To quote John hodgeman, ‚Äúno, because words have meaning‚Äù
===
@GailSimone ...but what if he had to fight the wienerschnitzel?
===
@GailSimone No, she's a hot woman. Rather disrespectful tbh.
===
@ryantriddle @GailSimone In that case, call me Kobayashi.
===
@GailSimone That‚Äôs that love song to Cyclops where the guy‚Äôs like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt raise your eyes / you‚Äôll release all that heat vision‚Äù right?
===
@ami_angelwings @GailSimone Lore episodes were pretty good, but I think the best episodes were monster of the week episodes. 

Clyde Bruckman‚Äôs Final Repose, Jose Chung‚Äôs From Outer Space, Bad Blood, The Postmodern Prometheus, Humbug... I bet most fans top ten episodes are majority monster of the week
===
@ami_angelwings @GailSimone Mytharc is kinda lame, looking back on it. These days I'm less fond of stories centered around government conspiracy. It's more fun when it's just this weird part of america and these agents just need to dig in and survive.
===
Why would you do this? https://t.co/F3Y4Ta76Y6 https://t.co/zZUftDQ1il
===
@GailSimone A couple times just at signings. First time was probably like the last or second to last Wondercon in SF and then the last physical SDCC I caught ya too. You signed some Secret Six trading cards of mine=)

#IMetGail
===
@GailSimone This is a hot dog. https://t.co/BruiOziE6E
===
@GailSimone It's a tiny Gordon Ramsay.
===
@GailSimone Everything can be a hot dog if you believe in yourself.
===
@ami_angelwings @GailSimone MOTW all the way! There's definitely some very strong lore episodes, but the MOTW episodes are where the show really shines, and their stand-alone nature makes them very rewatchable.
===
@GailSimone It‚Äôs like regular DC but for ‚Äúadults‚Äù
===
@ami_angelwings @GailSimone There's some great episodes all round but monster of the week gave us 'Tooms'
===
@GailSimone Please include visual reference for the Mexicans in the audience
===
@GailSimone It doesn't have to be one or the other https://t.co/6P4yniTPdW
===
@KurtBusiek @GailSimone I can hear the pauses to sip coffee. Showin' our age. Good Day!Gryphon Needs Donuts Badly!
===
@KurtBusiek @GailSimone We need to know more about the donuts!  Come on guys, prioritize!
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail in 2018, at @ComicCon_Paris. Got her to sign me some #Deadpool stuff.
===
@GailSimone would you mind RTing the poll tweet to your followers? I'm trying to get as large a sample as possible. Thank you! https://t.co/zaClhrYD9C
===
@GailSimone They‚Äôre not the ones I took!
===
@LarryDixonTGK @GailSimone The first Krispy Kreme in the area had just opened. Mark Waid was enthusiastic about it, so Ann and I stopped by before the show and picked up some as a surprise.

And now you know‚Ä¶the rest of the story.
===
@dichromaniac @GailSimone the snake, his tail consumed
===
@GailSimone we have had a months long argument with my DnD group about what is, and is not a hot dog.

It's been very contentious.

I would suggest, not a hot dog.
===
@GailSimone Maize https://t.co/RTxvNJlXcc
===
@MythicalChef well? https://t.co/uuNGevysaw
===
@dichromaniac @GailSimone Agreed 100%
===
@dichromaniac @GailSimone I wish I didn't know what all of those words meant.
===
I misread this as "is a gorilla a hot dog", which I'm going to say "yes" to just to start an argument. https://t.co/mvMt8g4dNd
===
@GailSimone Dear @tacobell . Or even @Wendys .
Well?
===
@GailSimone Some questions don't need answers.
===
@GailSimone Gord Ita was the greatest player the Edmonton Oilers ever had in the 2000s.
===
@GailSimone Of course this is the first thing I see when I open Twitter lmao
===
@GailSimone The only being on Earth that could have answered that question is no longer with us. https://t.co/d0448jUyHo
===
@GailSimone Scarlet Witch&gt; Constantine‚Äôs side chick
===
@GailSimone I don‚Äôt know but now I want one of each. 
ü•∫üåÆüå≠
===
@GailSimone no that's you
===
@GailSimone No. It has no hotdog sausage in it. It‚Äôs a kind of taco.
===
@SkyknightLCG @GailSimone Nope, a gordita is basically a Mexican dish that‚Äôs made out of tortilla that can be filled up with chicharron, frijol or literally anything
===
@SkyknightLCG @GailSimone They are exquisite tho
===
@GailSimone Only the double cheesy gordita crunch.
===
@dean_martinez16 @GailSimone So with a hot dog too?
===
@GailSimone Everyone knows that gorditas are milkshake ducks wrapped in bean dads served with a side of shrimp cereal.
===
@WordsByNat @GailSimone Me neither. But it also tickles some weird language part of my brain and I can‚Äôt stop laughing.
===
@GailSimone No... a hotdog cam be a sandwich, and I'll even let a gordita be considered a sandwich, but I don't think a gordita could/should be considered a hot dog
===
@GailSimone No because that would mean pupusas are hot dogs and if pupusas are hot dogs then that also means quesadillas are hot dogs
DONT WORDS MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU PEOPLE?!?!?!?
===
@GailSimone How about his douchey cousin StefanWolf
===
@GailSimone Everything is a hot dog
===
@GailSimone That depends. 

Do you mean an ACTUAL gordita or a Taco Bell gordita?
===
@GailSimone Well, if it is then obviously the next question would be is it a sandwich, and that could get ugly
===
@GailSimone yes of course
===
@BelleChere @GailSimone That‚Äôs pretty cool
===
@mikeyhatesit @GailSimone Greyhounds are so graceful! https://t.co/gAKPVgFlma

@GailSimone For those looking to introduce their kids to PnP RPGs, the Hero Kids core rulebook PDF is currently free on DriveThru RPG: https://t.co/ZNao8MSoHU
===
@GailSimone Met you in Niagara Falls a few years ago. You were lovely and said many great things you liked about my city.
===
@mikeyhatesit @GailSimone I like how greyhounds are basically super gentle and take their time and care until they need to go fast and whoosh! Off they go to save they day like a superhero.
===
@GailSimone #IMetGail at DragonCon and C2E2 and got a couple of books signed at each. The interaction was brief but pleasant and charming.
===
@GailSimone Gail are you writing a troll/bear specific expansion set?  Cause I *will* start playing again.
===
So which is it? POLUTION or MASKS?!?!
Next, it'll be masks IN pollution. ü§£ https://t.co/UHe3RQAjC7
===
@GailSimone it was well deserved. I got to shake the man‚Äôs hand. That was good enough for me.
===
@JoanSGarrison @GailSimone Who calls corn flashlight???
===
@GailSimone Could we get a #RestoreTheSnyderVerse from the queen?
===
@GailSimone We met at sdcc when you did a signing at prism booth a few years back. #nightnurselove
===
@GailSimone This greyhound seems to have that Captain America energy üòÇ https://t.co/Q77P9RDG2T
===
@GailSimone It's especially fun to witness them doing that thing where they've slowed down and the other dogs catch up and then ZOOOOOMMMMMM!

Like that comic with Superman and Flash racing.
===
@Heathen_bird @GailSimone Gritty pretzels.
===
@GailSimone It's when you're eating a Snyder's pretzel that's so salty your lips crack (mine do anyway).
===
@GailSimone Not yet but I sure do hope to get to meet you someday!üòÉ
===
@GailSimone Hey gail, join the fight with us? #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
===
@toddYoungonline @GailSimone I had to hold a laugh in over that.
