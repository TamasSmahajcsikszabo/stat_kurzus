my favorite genre of photography is ‚Äúany still image of an actress holding a gun‚Äù
===
To the movie‚Äôs credit, it manages some sympathy for characters that don‚Äôt deserve any and satirizes the genre fairly well. The fish looks better than I expected and there are some decent gore moments.

@wikivictorian Barry Lyndon is my favorite movie in any genre; the costumes are god tier https://t.co/PIVhLfDQ4w

This genre of music Demi is in for dancing with the devil suits her voice so well!! Like that theatre vibe is so good on her voice, she sounds amazing
===
#SaintMaud star Morfydd Clark isn‚Äôt fond of Horror Movies - Despite being a lead character in the movie, she isn‚Äôt fond of the genre it represents.

The House with a Clock in Its Walls  3/5
I love @eliroth in his prime genre &amp; also welcome such detours to experience him as a director differently. This fantasy family movie just feels as it stayed in its comfort zone, not using to the fullest its potential, cast- &amp; story-wise. https://t.co/yCp6g5Lb1H

#TheLoft (2014)

A decent mystery thriller narrated in Non-linear narrative screenplay. 

Its neither a riveting mystery thriller kind nor a sensual erotic stuff kind, fall short in both genre.

BGM of this movie is fabulous throughout üî• &amp; i loved it more than the movie https://t.co/RWvn5W3Ua0

I still find myself watching movie critics talking about Man Of Steel after 8 years... That movie is a MASTERPIECE. Henry Cavill is the best modern Superman we could ever get. And Zack Snyder is a beast when it comes to comic book genre. I don‚Äôt care what anyone says.

@uapresearch I agree, one of the most innovative in a long while - usually when they¬¥se supposed to be "tounge in cheek" genre transcending -they usually get to smart for their own good and loose at lot of "heart" because all efforts are focused on the in movie jokes and references.
Good cast
===
@Tim_Pilcher @disneyplus I think what makes it stand out is that those elements are still in the movie, but not blended together, so it feels like it ricochets from one genre to another, scene by scene. It was, at the time, the most expensive movie Disney had ever made, and the first to be rated PG.

If there will be a movie about the stuck ship what genre will it be?
===
Incase anyone is wondering, the movie was called the Dark Relic. It held my interest for all of about 4-6min, after I noticed it was free and was listed by my cable provider as the same genre as Dracula Untold, which seemed far better. Haven't finished either one.

@_oliviagrace I agree. I can‚Äôt afford tickets for the Nash, the Old Vic + Travel. It‚Äôs the cost of a family holiday! Seen some amazing shows I would never have had the opportunity to see otherwise, reaching bigger audiences. I hope digital theatre stays as a genre. Now that it‚Äôs established.

@AppleTV I don‚Äôt normally respond but I watched this and it was gripping from start to finish. Very much in the genre of an ‚Äòold war movie‚Äô but very suspenseful

@mickymi51203446 @wxncxxg I understand that some SF and CSW fans feel frustrated, probably bcs they have high expectation for CSW after the success of SF &amp; want to see him in more roles like that. But they really need to wake up, CSW isn't the kind of actor who only play one genre.

#RangDe Review ‚ÄîFeel Good Romantic Drama

Overall, #RangDe offers nothing new concerning the story, but it is also engaging and enjoyable at the same time. The casting, visuals and writing do the trick. If you love the genre, it is an easy one-time watch.

@IndieRevolver Watchmen is his best movie.

Strongly disagree about his DCEU movies being bad, some of the best in the genre imo.

Rewatching Train to Busan with my partner and I'm really struck by just how good this movie is. How well paced it is, how tense every scene feels, and how it makes a joke out of most other movies in its own genre by just doing it so much better.

no cheating: you're starring in a movie w/ the last person saved in your camera roll and the last song you listened to is the title

i wonder what kind of movie genre it is... https://t.co/2YokwS283Z https://t.co/dHNJCsD4No
===
#TheOne first half is so much of facepalm moments which doesnt really allow us to be immersed in the movie. But the interval point is intriguing, seems like a shift from the genre. Lets see. So far, below average.

201. #KingsmanTheSecretService

This movie is just fuckin‚Äô spectacular. A brilliant tribute to the spy genre filled with excellent action and an equally entertaining story. A stylish and fun send up to the James Bond series that also pays its respects.

The Radio Rental podcast is a fun take on the ghost story pod genre. It is hosted by the fictional Terry Carnation, who introduces each story a la the Cryptkeeper. Terry is portrayed by actor Rainn Wilson. 

&amp; Terry just started his *own* show.  Go listen to #DarkAir!
===
@PanzerCrush @Rhymeswithbowl @artyomtopilin I dont think the buddy cop genre is as well known in the 50s as it is the 80s? Ha-ha. But the movie was dog trash so if it was modern, enjoy modern. 
Wouldnt want to be outdated, so just make edgy Batman a dummy who unsuccessfully fights Superman with terrible tactics, good take.

How did the "White man is mad at the world so he decides to take 'justice' in his own hands and commit mass murder" become a movie genre that people actually enjoy watching?

Your gripe with modern horror shouldnt be that folks are soft. People are just people, &amp; blaming your fellow citizens is petty and dumb. The problem isnt even modern films, since I'd argue we're in a horror movie renaissance with some of the best stuff the genre's had in decades.

I'm constantly agitated by fellow #horror fans misunderstanding of the current climate of the genre. Just a couple days ago, I heard some YouTubers complain that the new "Scream" movie would probably be "woke", while they openly admitted they didn't even know what that term meant

@badal_bnftv Badal bhai, please watch &amp; review anime movie named "Perfect Blue". This movie belongs to psychological horror genre. https://t.co/0vSU3dFmpZ

I hope the horror genre actually stops relying on ‚Äúteenagers horny must have sex‚Äù to carry their movie. It‚Äôs weird that they have in their agenda (15-18 yr) kids having sex. Do they stop n think for one second to understand that‚Äôs wrong??

Now, it's time to explore.. space genre, adventure genre, high octane actions movie, fantasy genre etc other thing..

A lil cliche but it's interesting. In their defence, you'd really find a Romcom or romance themed movie without cliches.
It's a 7/10 for me and that's because that's my favorite movie genre.
I rarely give Nollywood movies a 5

@fiyyahhamed I woudlnt say I dont care for the genre cuz I obviously love fantasy but growing up the books nor the movie never captivated me at all and I just never got into it. But yeah I have seen a couple of the movies. I wont say I love it nor hate it. But I also wont watch it on my own.

@Masss__pirate The Masterpiece Cannot Be Spoken But It Is One Of The Best Movie In That Genre...
===
I consider myself to be a movie buff, and I love watching all kinds of movies, from Oscar worthy ones to silly ones made by Rob Schneider. 

Right now, I am fed up with crime genre, I just want to watch a movie that is similar to the Notebook, I just love that movie. https://t.co/ruaPS07CCT
===
@thebox_movie musical animations and movies are always my favorite...like coco, and now the box! I think this is chanyeol's fav genre too.ü§çü•∫I cant wait to see this loey‚ú®u worked hard! thank u for everything.
===
@KEEMSTAR Think about it Keem. Comedy as a movie genre is pretty dead, BUT it's a common sub-genre of other movies. People expect Spider-Man or Ant Man to have jokes and be witty/funny. Action movies in general go for that balance of action, drama, comedy evenly nowadays.
===
The last four movies I have logged on Letterboxd I find funny. It‚Äôs 3 classics considered to be some of the greatest of their genre. Then the Ben 10 finale movie. I‚Äôm a man of taste what can I say! https://t.co/5ybunky7QB

horror is the best movie genre
===
@jasonkilar @hbomax With all due respect sir, when we say #RestoreTheSnyderVerse  we want to restore creativity and bring cinema back in superhero genre. We wish to restore a person's hard work who planned atleast 10 years ahead while sticking to the rich folklore of DC.

Like if I was making a movie (any genre) and had hundreds of millions of dollars, I promise you the first thing I would do is offer the most prominent male authority figure role, age 50-65, to literally the greatest actor who ever lived
===
@onfda +. So, can you recommend me a movie with action or romance genre?

Big Shout out to @horrorwolf666 for hosting a badass podcast. We had a rad time. This is the podcast for you if you love horror, genre, and cinema. Give it a listen. üíÄ@crilenger @_MsBones_ https://t.co/fsJtfrcrnm

@ParalivesGame Zodiac would be a cool thing to add. Also favorite colors, foods, maybe if they prefer the ocean or the forrest, favorite flower (also other paras could give that flower as gifts if they know them personally), favorite genre of music and movie, favorite animal.
===
I hate my love for the mind-bending movie genre sometimes it's 'damn that movie was dope' but mostly it's 'what in the sam hill did I just watch?'
===
My favorite actor Kim Nam Gil   and Jin (@sissassy favorite) at one drama...

And the drama genre is comedy or dark comedy...

I'll start praying now... https://t.co/gSPFTm6U5f

@munconvos movie genre
===
I have absolutely IDOLIZED the Muppets for as long as I can remember and this is a result of that. Jim Henson is more genius than I ever grave him credit for because here I am, a perfectly trained actor for a very niche movie genre. Incredible. This is a big moment for me. (2/2)
===
@bapIuv literally though... as much as i appreciate saw and what it did for the genre it resulted in a lot of directors thinking gore was an easy ticket to a 'good' horror movie
===
Like, this movie is legendary even in the "car movie" genre. It debuted the new Dodge Challenger, revolutionized car films along with 2 Lane Blacktop, and was so influential decades later that Audioslave did an entire video echoing the movie.
