@XxPAGZxX I assume you are talking video games. I am still pretty new to the video game scene but I have years of board game experience. I will watch a play through or a @dicetower_news review to see if it hits my game groups buttons.
===
@SolarDies @glolfRebbeca Every time I see him play against someone who isn't himself, he's lost. And since you both win and lose a match against yourself, Dicetower has technically lost all his matches. Ouch
===
THIS JUST IN: Dicetower played a game against someone that wasn't a clone of himself (and got destroyed)

Has someone told Dicetower that we found Pattie? I think they'd love to know.
===
@RazorDefrost HAH! Dicetower was SCREWED over by the gods, got complacent via clone matches. Then boom. It's Shakespeare material.

Showing off a bit of 3d printing since my Ender 3 is slowly starting to get fully dialed in. Now I have to maybe start painting these things.

@therealjpster @Sickeroni Yesss! There was some resin trapped inside a dicetower we printed and over time it worked it's way through the cured resin. The resin leaked all over my pen&amp;paper dice and pretty much dissolved them. :(
===
I made a #dicetower as inspired by @JosiahBrooks @conjuredcraft @TabletopTime ( @NarratorDave @Jen_nobi @KamiKazilik ) &amp; Black Magic Craft @BMCliveshow &amp; of course #kingalfredthegreat

And there we go! The tower is finished. I have been making a few of these as I test new ideas on assembling and finishing them.
This one is being sent to a friend. She wanted to play D&amp;D so I helped her get a PH &amp; dice.

Dice tower designed, &amp; laser cut (thanks @ponokohq).  5th experimental one. Design works fine &amp; now testing with assembly. Bamboo veneer, with cherry stain. And had my d20 logo laser-etched to see how that worked out. #dicetower #DnD https://t.co/COM6aXGcMd

Today we felt the new dice tower. Does it need it? No, but it really softens the sound of dice rolling. I've used brused on, and spray on glues and in the end? Self-adhesive felt works just as well and is MUCH easier to trim and apply. #dicetower #dnd #rpgs #dungeonsanddragons https://t.co/SW8c7NTA4K

Dice tower felting went faster than expected. The adhesive backed felt really speeds things up. Went ahead and glued it up. Applied rubber bands so it all goes together straight. Leave it overnight then remove the bands. Then we're done.
