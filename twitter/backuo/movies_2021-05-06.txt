@MatthewWRossi As for the movie itself, at that time, fantasy movies were relegated to bottom of the barrel stuff like Beastmater and Red Sonya. Getting Ron Howard on board for Willow and Ridley Scott for Legend put some life back into the genre in Hollywood, even if they failed at the time.

@Olfya @TeaPoweredHuman It was N&amp;S that first made me a fan of AM-M. She's a great actor. 😎

Tho I liked Death at Pemberley and found her Lizzie a great proto 'Ms Marple', I just didn't like the cross genre product overall.

Bruh wait til you see a movie from this genre called horror it’s shocking what they will put out now as a cash grab  and like obviously as a tool to make people more centrist about murder

@bjornwilliams24 I don’t understand, how is a POC actor playing Superman sloppy seconds? 

There have no less than 5 Batmen in 20 years, 3 Spider-Men, Superhero genre is a den of regurgitated ideas. 

A POC playing Superman doesn’t cheapen the actor or character.

@MoaningDC Ha ha... Sorry! 😝 Fair play to your mate for enjoying it and for making the front cover! 

It’s a VERY different film to the previous ones. And in fact it even includes a line which pokes fun at the genre it’s relying upon to put bums on seats! Strange movie... 👍☺️

@PLT_cheater To be fair Wanda Vision started out with the feel of a wonderfully bizarro, genre-ransacking, theatre school class project. But yeah it shows signs of getting a bit more predictably superheroish.

Not SPOORLOS (THE VANISHING), though I agree it is very unsettling. Similar feelings for FUNNY GAMES, but that's a message movie. I don't have opinions on the torture porn genre other than I find it distasteful. But I will say there is evil in SLAPSTICK OF ANOTHER KIND. https://t.co/qgp8WXbxud

@GriffTheImpaler @baddestmamajama @brofromanother Saw 1, is, I think, an interesting little movie. The sequels really went downhill fast.

Hostel is shit. But oddly, Roth seemed to take the criticism to heart because Hostel 2 is a genuinely good movie. Oh, sure, its gory. But it dissects the genre in a very satisfying way. YMMV

Zombie Survival - Shaun of the Dead

I could go on for 20 posts about this movie. The level of horror is at about a Ghostbusters level, but that’s not an insult. Nobody blends any genre with feel good comedy like the Chinese do, and this movie does the Horror blend with some action. 4/5
===
This looks great, but can we stop with the "last western" spin? It's already embarrassing and gross that the most quintessentially American genre doesn't contain a single film by a woman director with a studio-level budget in its 100 year existence. Let's not make that a mandate. https://t.co/45gyE2mYiY

I’ve had people try to tell me I’m not “whatever” enough to be a true horror fan (fill in various reasons). Sure, I don’t watch a horror movie every day or post about horror every chance I get, but that doesn’t mean I don’t love the genre. Where do people get off? Dickheads. 🙄

@danirat I love horror comedies because of the accessibility they offer non-horror friends when I wanna have movie nights, but also slashers. They were my first love that got me into the genre and I just genuinely appreciate the creativity of the practical effects that went into them.
===
I do love a good genre mash movie. A body-swap horror movie? IN. A Zom-Rom-Com? IN. Sci-Fi Western? SUPER IN.

But mashing "Holocaust Movie" with "Dog Movie"? HARD PASS. https://t.co/3m7gfF216L

Literally watch Netflix damn near every other day. It rotates with Hulu, Disney+, and YouTube.
Y’all gotta watch more than what’s “new &amp;popular”.

Being from Chicago and Horror being my favorite genre, I was soooooooo thirsty for the new Candyman movie. The panoramic ruined their roll out 😭
===
@americanwombat Keeping in mind I haven't read any children's books in decades, would catering more to the literary tastes of parents enrich the genre? I've always thought Where the Wild Things Are was bad, but the movie was so much worse..
===
interesting too. I am not a huge fan of the drama genre (I don’t hate it just don’t love it), but this movie had a very interesting &amp; intriguing plot to go along with the acting!
===
Saw (2004)

This movie is absolutely wild &amp; so dirty. The set design is disgusting. But even after watching it a few times, each twist &amp; turn totally draws me in. It has a great blend of horror, detective drama, &amp; anxiety-inducing action. Revolutionary to the modern horror genre. https://t.co/n2TJ44WcVu

M is one of the most influential movies ever made. 

With suspense that out-suspenses Hitchcock, excellent cinematography &amp; a deep sociological layer added to it, M is one of the masterpieces of the psychological thriller genre.

@stainlss_blxxm // It’s mostly just a language thing. English fits better with “Columbina” while Italian fits better with “Colombina”. CDA is just another genre of theatre.

Or a director we love, or a topic/genre we follow. They get to be individuals, we don’t. We’re the money, the viewers, the data via pre-planned category. We’re never able to be in power here &amp; define ourselves, because we’re the people, the fans. Those who provide what they need.

Reading people talking about the Resident Evil formula  from the outside really fucking comes across in the same way as people who watch the new 'elevated horror' Ari Aster movie and then just never interact with the genre again tbh

Blending immersive camerawork and dynamic storytelling, A Mutineer’s Guide to Modern-Day Piracy is a genre-busting digital theatre show about female empowerment, underground insurgencies, and the hunt for your inner pirate. 

Ship just got real.

===
@JonDonahue When you look at films that have matured within the genre, like The Dark Knight or Unbreakable, I think a case for Superman: The Movie becomes increasingly hard to make. But even looking at what kind of film it attempts to be, it’s not even the best version of that
===
Run is the best movie I’ve seen in a while. Highly recommend if you’re into the psycho thriller genre.

@prestructural My fave when they just talk about its place in the franchise or series or trilogy or about author or genre. Everything but the movie. Same for books

@azrielswt what movie genre do u like bestie?
===
Maybe Joe and Nicky from #TheOldGuard could be solid contenders. 

Obviously of a very different style and genre (although, yk, immortal husbands and all that!) but yeah Joe/Nicky is another pairing that is beautiful and that made quite an impression when the movie aired
===
@Da_Nerdette Because the original made a billion dollars and is the most profitable movie in the history of the genre.
===
@IGN I think the dominance of the Super Hero genre over cinema has finally come to the end. Marvel's Phase 4 looks like trash, DC can't get their expanded universe off the ground and audiences by now must be exhausted with countless reboots; plus going 'woke' just never works.
===
@Nivagdetrolley @ManMadeMoon Although I'm reliably informed that there's a narrative running through all of the films which transcends the mere racing of cars. A genre all of its own which owes a lot to French New Wave, cinema of the early 60s.

Did some sci-fi reading this week. High Rise novel is obviously more complex than callow Tom Huddleston movie. Ballard’s characters are charming. This book might look cliched to film buff in 2021 but this was genre defining classic which came out in 1975. https://t.co/U2aCoRCUeN

My favourite music genre is the one where it seems like they  just picked up their guitar and sang their current thoughts

They’ll be like “I love the 🎸princess diaries and Anne Hathaway 😫, but the sequels ruined 😓the magic of the first movie🎶”

And I’ll be like oh word?
===
@stephpaterson_ I would recommend watching a show/movie where you’re loosely inspired to write in that genre. I find that sometimes the best inspiration to write that next project should come from just watching, reading, or studying something you know is going to boost your interests.

@sweetholyhun Not a genre. But That’s my favorite Meryl Streep movie actually 😭😭
===
I'm glad to see that Paul Verhoeven is bringing the "horny nun" genre back to cinema.
===
@Savion Why was anyone’s acting or movies ever a thing? He had gigs, he did them, end of story. I guess you could see his genre as “Russel Brand type movies.” The same could be said of any other actor centric movies based on personality and style. Seth Rogen stoner movies for example.

@CrowofYharnam @CisqoSuawce @BigGazzaLad @THEAP99 @IGN @tristanogilvie I didn't say what genre Returnal was btw, no need to correct me ik what it is 😂

"Movie games" are called narrative driven story games, where you follow a linear story through different gameplay styles. They are in fact games and are arguably sell the most copies
===
@CrowofYharnam @CisqoSuawce @BigGazzaLad @THEAP99 @IGN @tristanogilvie There it is 😂

"Fake gamers"

Also, you proved my point. "Movie game", yeah, it's a separate genre to an action or RPG game.

Let other people enjoy games, don't being them down for experiencing truly great stories.

anyway, the movie called The Mitchells vs. the Machines. i recommended to watch this movie, its a family genre movie so its safe to watch. for me its 8/10 because i love family genre so much! available on Netflix too.

@N4rfu @CisqoSuawce @BigGazzaLad @THEAP99 @IGN @tristanogilvie No Returnal is a roguelike where you die over and over again fighting bosses and movie games aren't a genre

@LacunaeAnnikov Being able to straight up just take a fucking term for an entire genre as your title just shows their arrogance.

Its like naming a drama movie "The Drama Movie 2021."

@historyofthemcu ... be at all similar to humanity, like, in pretty much any way whatsoever. But again, the genre doesn’t need to be realistic to create entertaining, powerfully resonant stories- as is the case here. This movie still fuckin slaps, even if I find this particular image hokey.

@BrndnStrssng All I know about this is certain Twitter celebs losing their shit over whether or not Liang really re-write Max Landis or not.  It was so annoying but I really should give this movie a shot anyway so we can get more female fronted genre pictures
===
@Hope_Corrigan Is it though? I've seen so many horror movies, it's basically a parody genre at this point!
I'm not even sure Alien is the originator of this stuff, but it is a formative movie of the horror genre, and so you'd expect others to use its formula for lols or scares I guess.

@ProjectAurora5 Story, theres no genre that allows as much story in a video game (or movie).

My favorite movie genre is western love stories. How about you?
===
You see this movie and you understand where a whole genre of comedy came from (like “Girls”) https://t.co/V0AxbL0tn8
===
@aceofdramas It wasn't bad but my actual delight was sering #ChaSeungWon because hevreminded me of his movie Kick the Moon with #Kimhyesoo. Maybe they could have another movie together. An action movie since they are both good in that genre. Perhaps rival gang bosses that fall in love. 😊

I Repeat No Telugu hero can Match Your actings skills..

What was the most wierd and horrific movie you have ever seen?

For me it's the dystopian future genre that give me chills.

Purge,Black Mirror,Interstellar all have some kind of dark and sad undertone which I find very repulsive.
===
horror is my favorite movie genre and there is approximately 4 horror movies in existence

i hope one day i will be loved enough by someone that they make a playlist of movie scores that remind them of me

movie scores are so freaking versatile and it is such an incredible genre of music pls don’t hate on what i like

@AllThingsSnyder Yeah really. They trust Zack so much. They know he makes genre breaking masterpieces and they start conversations 
The more people to talk about the movie the more the ip gets known the more Netflix gets worded. 
Pretty much better than warner bros decision
===
@egirlprivilege @wackjag that’s why I like Blair Witch so much man. it was my first found footage movie and it changed the way I look at horror as a genre. I think it might also be why I enjoy ARGs like marble hornets and everymanhybrid so much. diy or die baybee
===
i need any content with this type of genre... omg imagine jay in an action movie [grips thigh]
===
@SamtanicPanic I think it has a lot to do with the genre. Like a good romance director may be shit with a sports movie.

Additionally who's bright idea was it to have one dude do the 1st and 3rd movie and a different guy do the 2nd? That's a recipe for disaster there.

Can anyone give me a good movie to watch? Can be any length, genre, whatever.

@Sharito742 @Luiz_Fernando_J Endgame didn’t do anything to move CBMs forward apart from cramming ridiculous amounts of characters into a movie. How was it going to be over for the whole genre? Endgame wasn’t even as good as it predecessor

@wbpictures @Lionsgate @Caseybloys @hbomax @Shudder @RobertIger movie idea genre neutral pitch: Famous Author hits an estate sale they find the type writer they've always longed for. Long story short, the writings start to become reality and run wild on the township. https://t.co/A5FcQePfpA
===
Don't Breathe 2 existing proves that they're just gonna fully embrace the logistical ridiculousness of the ending of Don't Breathe 1. It's horror at its finest. Making use out of a phenomenal character actor is the genre's greatest past time.
===
@slimyswampghost the movie is decent, too, imo. but I just love the genre of films that's "John Cusack losing his shit"
===
@HVESBOY @YeezusTPAB2 @hannahmarz1 @chartdata Not y’all discrediting the amount of genre-jumping and versatility Gaga has showed in her past works. And saying all her moves “nowadays” are calculated when she’s working on a movie because she is a successful actress.... unlike, you know?

What’s the one iconic horror movie that when you say you’ve never seen it people give you “the look” (you know which one I mean 😏) For me it’s Blair Witch Project. I’m personally not a huge fan of the found footage sub genre so it’s never interested me much!

Omg THISS is how I feel about all movies. Can we create a new genre where the 20 minutes of absolute bliss in the beginning just lasts the whole movie and there’s never any problem? https://t.co/MdoZjIDLbs

@AblazaLuis Tbh I respect all preferences but I never found the appeal in the horror genre in games/movies. A little horror movie with friends might be somewhat fun but playing a horror game by yourself just seems like torture imo

If they made a movie from your life, what genre would it be like?
===
@sappfs hello oliver B) small little random question: do you have a favorite movie/video-game genre?
===
Pandemic movies will never hit the same lol. That genre of movie is dead.
===
Yeah so I watched more stuff.
Movie 3 was HellHouse LLC:
Pretty good for found footage (it’s my favorite genre) and vaguely believable, the ending was a bit lame and the acting wasn’t super great though. A mild 7/10
===
@therealphwu @POC_Culture I am very happy he’s returning to this genre. I agree, loved his Dawn of the Dead. This is a space where I think he really excels as a filmmaker - also a zombie-heist movie sounds like a blast
===
But its really hitting everything I love about the genre, blade runner is my favorite movie of all time so this is extreme bias but yeah man its dope the glitches are really minor from what ive noticed game is much more stable than I heard (could be ps5+ updates)
===
@UnFuckingKnown7 no but like the specifics?? how exact?? from the leads to the genre to a reputable director and it’s all wrapped as a digital project???!!!!! it’s all we have wanted! All I wanted was just want furki and aybüs with a gun going pew pew and ughhhhh Patricia I DONT UNDERSTAND
===
Answers to genre questions in a book/show/movie are best when they're obvious and opaque. Outright confirmation is anti-climatic while ignoring implications is insulting to an audience. They need to know the reason, even if it's never stated. #amwriting
===
@beefy_tomato @dearapriII my favorite genre of movie
===
@ICOnomiks A HORRO GAME is supposed to be scary that is the whole fucking point of the genre, would you complain that some gay people are too gay or a comedy movie is too funny and they should tone it down? It is stupid right? It is exactly what happened here with RE a HORROR game
===
watching the marksman… why do people keep making these movies where the old yt man needs to save the poor helpless minority? it’s like a whole genre and they all rub me the wrong way. the marksman is a lame ass movie.
===
@Franklinbrats21 @DiscussingFilm I have not ever once watched a single star wars movie that was rainbows and sunshines or had any humor (Since when was it ever apart of the comedy genre?).
===
The true crime genre really has some some people sick in the head. Like this is real life? Not a movie? Just cuz your fave podcast or whatever makes jokes about at these atrocities doesn’t mean it’s not serious?
===
this is the best genre of movie https://t.co/x2nojgwAM6
===
@xoMissDanielle For me it’s when my movie taste gets degraded just because I haven’t seen “a cult classic that defined a genre” 

Like okay.. now I don’t want to watch it bc you were mean for no reason lol.
===
@Gemini_queen72 Same. Love horror. Consider myself horror movie connoisseur but I’ve never been a big fan of the zombie genre
===
@GregoryStringer @kaitabasis It deals a lot with mental illness (the main character is scheduled for a new procedure...a lobotomy!). There is an undertone of homosexuality and it is part of the horror movie about the depraved homosexual genre.
===
Blade Runner:
I can understand why this is the poster child for the neo-noir genre, gotta admit it dragged in a few places for my taste but the world Ridley Scott created and the thick atmosphere carried the movie through the slower parts. https://t.co/TA3Iqp2Ai3
===
@Dewiwrites So don’t. Lots of people find lots of things not funny or scary or touching or whatever. Some people go their entire life not watching entire genres of movie without talking about how they don’t like them. Sure some genre you love someone else doesn’t.
===
the tim roth gets injured at the beginning of the movie and spends the rest of the runtime bleeding and crying genre appeals to me

@80sHorrorDoc "Lost" films:What might have been?Projects Directors  wanted to make in the 80's,but could not &amp; the reasons as to why:Censorship?Budgets-For a genre that is usually made on the cheap,what DOES it cost to make a Horror movie?Special Effects not to the level needed?Changing times?
===
@80sHorrorDoc What did theater owners think of Horror in the 80s?VHS stores probably loved the genre for its profitability with rentals but how hard was it actually to get ones Horror movie into a theater? Even with the growth of multiplexes in suburban malls?

@dukefan1909 @TheCinemaTicket Helll yeah awesome movie from acting to soundtrack to genre rock on
===
an underrated and somewhat lost genre of movie is what I call the schlock switcheroo, which is when you start out as one kind of relatively grounded movie and halfway through just steer the things straight into bonkersville. basically only horror movies do that now
===
@realJackEason For everything? I only do that when I have more than a couple of discs by the same director. The rest are by genre, nation or label.
===
@IkebukurosKing He couldn't hide that hint of enthusiasm in his voice.

"Sure, I'd love to go on a movie date with you. What kind of movie did you want to go see?"

She wasn't sure what sort of genre would interest him, other than romcoms.
===
After seeing Geralds Game I’m all for the “Character arc after being chained to something” genre of movie. https://t.co/qeox4W8Bv7
===
@wordofgreen Pacific Rim, for being exactly what you expect it to be. Guillermo del Toro showed a great deal of literacy in the mecha anime genre with that. The Man From Earth is my all time favourite movie, though. Intimate and philosophical, with an open question at its core.
===
No other film has had such an impact on the #Horror genre in the last 2 decades than Hideo Nakatas...The Ring. It shouldn't be understated how damn effective and influential this movie is! #Ring #JHorror #AsianHorror #HorrorFamily https://t.co/4cnf2zo6SG
===
First Class (2011) [✧✧✧✧]
Although the underutilization of some mutants like Emma Frost is completely unforgivable, this movie remains as one of the best origin movies in the genre. I love the Bond spy-thriller feel to it. Young Charles and Erik have amazing chemistry. https://t.co/phaRHrAdvk
===
@GhostCorp2077 It helps when the filmmakers love the character, the genre and #TheSeries. This stands in stark contrast to the director of the 1998 film.
===
@glengyron they should make a movie about the cartels trying to do business in India.  Comedy-Action genre.
===
@oisinshare It has an abrupt ending which is my fav genre of cinema

@theacelibrarian @magicalmartha @CDaigleOrians Quinn, you’ve probably seen You’re Next, right? I love that movie’s take on the slasher/home invasion genre.
===
imma keep ranting abt this "disturbing movie" genre bc in all honesty how tf do u even come up with the idea that these movies have
===
@kbschroedy @1followernodad Yeah, the whole Love Drama genre needs to die they have nothing original left. if we're being honest what made movies like titanic good and the other is the actors and actress were really hot. What's the equivalent of a young Leo or Winslet in 2021.
===
@HostWithTheM0st Movie Genre: Horror

Since its #StarWarsDay...

Rogue One is a phenomenal movie. The best of the post original trilogy for sure. 

But to put it above New Hope/Empire doesn't seem fair.
Rogue One was a chapter in an established genre/universe. 
NH/ESB created that universe. Bonus pts for originality.
===
@hbryant42 Westerns has always been my favorite movie genre. Godless on Netflix is the best western I've ever seen.

@GMPaiella Is this a book, movie, TV series...? A whole new genre, from the sound of things.👍

@elleschneider What I’ve been saying for years: Directors should be allowed to make whatever genre they want and still retain their quirky directing styles that make up their films. 

See also: the last Bond director.

@chrisorbach @wordofgreen I wonder how long it would take to go though every memorable line of dialogue?  😆 I also firmly believe that this movie is required viewing in the “Buddy film” genre...

This summer about to be a movie, don’t know the genre yet
===
This may be one of the most over-hated and under appreciated films I’ve seen. I for one really like it and think it’s an amazing movie that is better then the vast majority of films in the genre today. I really wish the sequel kept the slightly darker tone and hope we get to see https://t.co/ndpLm5NX6F

I am around 5 minutes into #TheBadBatch I honestly didn't think I was going to be as into this show as the others, cause old War movie genre stuff isn't usually my thing. But I character appears almost immediately and I'm in. I'm invested now.
===
@kathleen_belew Ok, I actually watched it this afternoon.  It was not the movie I remembered, but I did see it when it was broadcast.  It seems to me that Nuclear Holocaust movies were a genre unto themselves in the late 70s-early 80s.
===
I was so obsessed with the coolest alternative title for Bava’s Bay of Blood that I used it as a lyric in HW’s “Combed Lips”. The movie itself is one of those proto-slashers like Black Christmas and Deep Red that both predicted and transcended the genre. https://t.co/isP3dNFBpT
