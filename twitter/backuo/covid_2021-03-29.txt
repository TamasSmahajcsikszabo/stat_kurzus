Two more friends have now tragically passed away from Covid in the last week. It‚Äôs a heartbreak. I remember seeing BTJ countless times back in the day with Rancid and Bouncing Souls. Get vaccinated when you can, wear a mask, skip me with your Liberty arguments. Stay safe. https://t.co/PrM24ntQUz

@ScottAdamsSays @REOSpeedDemon How about a world that if your are worried about covid to the point you want the vaccine, you get it. And you don‚Äôt try to tell others how to live their life? Or indirectly mandate behavior thru a passport

Does that logic connect with a Cali native?

Glad to see #TakeOffYourMask trending!
Masks are enforced as a visual reminder that there is danger everywhere to justify rollout of experimental vx@ines &amp; withdrawal of liberties
Govt dont care about mask quality or hygiene protocols &amp; ignore the harms caused #enoughisenough

I brushed my teeth this morning. I know I did. I‚Äôm tired but not THAT tired. 

My mask is telling me I didn‚Äôt brush my teeth. But I did. I really did.

@mistyhaych14 She's 100% right though. As soon as I put on my mask I immediately couldn't breathe, both my lungs collapsed, I contracted AIDS, face cancer, ebola, smallpox and had to have my foot amputated.

As soon as I took it off I was immediately cured. Masks are bad.

@klfaber1 I firmly believe that this is because with all the insane testing done, so many people were told they had COVID but never did (or never enough to generate ABs).

Because testing healthy people for a respiratory virus is not something we've ever done before.

@LetCounty @FidelibusAndrea @darrenshone1974 @nytimes This is what breeds people not wanting to get the vaccine.

All of this "science" we are being spoonfed is getting rediculous.

If this vaccine is so great, why are people still having to wear masks.

We are literally wearing masks forever and quarterly vaccine boosters.

@laworfiction Cv19 laws, who fines retailers that refuse disabled people that are exempt from wearing a mask entry, even with a Dr's letter, they still refuse.  Or is it just citizens at protest or gathering that are fined.
