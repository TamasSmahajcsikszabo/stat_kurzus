@JoyceSharp67 @DitchOntologist @IAVaccineAlerts By the numbers: 41% of Iowa Republicans don’t plan to be vaccinated compared with 8% of Democrats and 30% of independents, according to an Iowa Poll published by the Des Moines Register this month.

@washingtonpost No-one is upper or lower in the status as compared to other one. 

ALL ARE CREATION OF GOD. 

ALL ARE ABSOLUTELY EQUAL IN TERMS OF INEQUALITY OF HAPPINESS, HEALTH &amp; PEACE OF MIND. 

All will be either cremated or buried....

@washingtonpost Even if...you feel yourself as superior..no need to show-off and insult other creation of GOD who have achieved less.

Because..No creator likes insult of his creation.
If GOD becomes angry..He might interchange your status next time.

Pls don't say this is ur last trip at earth.
