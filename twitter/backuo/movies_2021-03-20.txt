@larainenewman Some people are very invested in the pulp power fantasies of their youth. For societal and economic reasons, this mythology has take over the current cinema. As a genre, they’re pretty skippable, but some people take them *way* seriously.

a) Marvel invented the idea of humor in genre films

@itsRyanUnicomb @garfep Also just a 4hr movie by definition is bloated, especially in this genre. Even the Irishman, which was meant to capture an entire lifetime, was a half hour shorter.
===
busters. well I was born in the 90s and grew up in china and I guess I'm just not into that genre even though it's kind of a must see. I've also seen that zombie movie where bill murray did a cameo.

good genre of movie is: ryan gosling walks around and kills people wearing a cool jacket

Give me movie to watch. any genre

@lankyframpard A S. Korean film "Shiri", although heavily dated and extremely 90's, is a fantastic movie collection since it was hailed as the start of the S Korean action / thriller movie genre and stars some serious heavy hitters. The trailer doesn't do it justice and sadly is only on DVD.

@Gabino_Iglesias Have you seen The Borderlands, it's a 2013 found footage movie that sort of redeemed the genre for my girlfriend and I. It has the typical investigators from the Vatican archetype in it but flips it by making the believers skeptics and the only nonbeliever the superstitious one.

@thediegocrespo @TheWafflePress I’ll add: I’ll really liked it. It’s the best DC movie.

@RiphadeOnTwitch @EntInsider @hbomax Um, nope.

Neither is a comic book movie.

ZSJL plows no new roads. It was better than the theatrical version, but won't be festooned like your examples, and won't dent the MCU's domination of the genre.

@fabiansociety The only other movie I can think of that even comes close is Easy Rider, and I don't think they really count as hitchhikers; and they didn't really do anything to them anyway. Harold &amp; Kumar sort of spoofs the genre but doesn't swap roles.

This is why the last 20 years or so of genre cinema have depressed me with their overwhelmingly bland, desaturated, color-shifted palettes.

Comparing e.g. the warm richness of #HarryPotter 1 &amp; 2, to HP 3 forward—so much of the visual magic &amp; wonder are drained with the color. https://t.co/5b1Uo0O389 https://t.co/iAHAW3KWdM

@Chemtririails Horror is my fav genre and after I watch a horror movie a few times there’s no scares anymore so the plot and the adrenaline high kick in idk how to describe it but I watch them like every other night.

-small character developments with the rest.

Would I say next-gen amazing? Nah, the movie is still a vision of 2017 (&amp; the time frame it had into making it from both directors); studios (Dosney), has finessed the Superhero genre &amp; story formula.

@C_M_Young I loved WandaVision, and can't wait for F&amp;WS. Winter Soldier is my favourite MCU movie, but mostly because of the spy espionage stuff, and I know the show is leaning more into the buddy cop genre. I'm just excited to see these two actors get to develop these characters more!

@JThomasOfficial I'm 100% with you, especially with genre films. Once I know I'm in, I'm done consuming anything else before the movie.
===
If I had a complaint about the movie, it’s that the whole genre has become very familiar, so even when it’s a true story it feels predictable, and playing it in an understated way like this one did doesn’t really grapple with that predictability in a way that mitigates it.]

@EmilyKaitlinnn High School Musical WAS a peak in film. That 2000s Mean Girls/HSM/Camp Rock teen craze movie was a genre that’s SO HARD to pull off and it deserves all the praise

@Moonspinner55 @DFacobbre I really enjoyed this movie, among the movies in this genre, especially of the period, such as say Harlow of Valley of the Doss, this one seems practically Wellesian. I don't remember the name dropping. I think it of as the creepy claustrophobic horror version.

@comicsexplained Idk if you look at any other movie genre movies aren’t compared to that genre’s agreed upon “best” nearly as much as cbms. People seem to be totally fine letting a movie be its own thing in other genres. I thought the movie was great! It’s what I always wanted in a JL movie.
===
@gyllnfilm honestly i think the only war movie i genuinely liked was saving private ryan. the genre is just so basic? like there’s soooo many of them and they basically all tell the same story but with varying levels of gore

@Stazingar Title: Black Hawk Down

Genre: War

@JL_Kdiamond I don’t like horror genre in general but Train to Busan is a gem. It’s really about the living. And forgive me but Ma Dong Seok steals this movie from everyone. What a performance!

@ayychris777 Yeah there are like very few “Christian” genre movies I have ever watched that I liked. Honestly only one is coming to mind and that was the Shack, but my friend ruined that movie for me because she told me that Mack is an Australian actor faking an American accent. I can’t 1/

If you're going to make a silly movie, fucking MAKE it.  It shines a light on how winking &amp; sarcastic so much of the genre has become. Movies made by people who think it's all pretty stupid. It may be. But I'm sick of watching shit by people who think they're above the material.
===
@AliceFromQueens I agree it almost certainly wasn't a hate crime, but just for the sake of argument... you don't have to be a proud, avowed racist to commit a racially motivated crime. Life isn't a genre movie, people don't have to spell out their motivations for the lowest common denominator.

@JAEHWANBLOOD Cube is a movie from 1997 and it's a pretty good thriller/horror (Ig, idk how to define the genre)

@mattzollerseitz Maybe it’s why (some) men are so fastidious about categorizing / organizing their media, or why determining a movie’s genre can cause fights: insecurity. When someone’s insecure about something they love, gaining trivia looks like expertise, and expertise looks like maturity.

@sepia_cinema Serg, I know u are hit/miss with superhero genre stuff but I'm confident that u will dig @falconandwinter it's an extension of the Captain America: WinterSoldier film &amp; it was terrific. Directed by #MalcomSpellman (now I really wish his #Confederate wasn't canceled)

===
@GargoylePhan @AgnewRobin Yep. The movie series is based on this classic novel. Groundbreaking back then, it’s pretty gritty compared to the fun films with Bill Powell and Myrna Loy, but it really holds up as solid PI Fiction. It’s foundational to the genre. <U+2764><U+FE0F> https://t.co/NXMK2LXhAO

#CallMeByYourName
I'm not a fan of this genre, but I like good movies. And this is certainly one. The first part it felt like it was a little bit too rushed, but the whole movie has this sort of oniric atmosphere, which is really beautiful. And the soundtrack is amazing.

OK Twitter peeps. Who would be interested in a quite informal "movie club"? There would be a large list of films, both old, cult favourite and modern classic across any genre. One would be selected randomly each week, we'd watch and then come back to discuss.

This is the type of movie you just have fun with. The characters, while unlikable at first, eventually grow on you. The creature designs are also uniquely inventive. I have a soft spot for genre films in high rise buildings, I guess.

Boy that MANIAC remake wasn't playing, eh? Pretty bold breaking out "Goodbye Horses", a couple of cheeky nods to the original, and it's pretty surprising that the first-person gimmick works as well as it does. Elijah Wood, quietly becoming a titan of genre cinema.

@RonFilipkowski @LizardRumsfeld What is the genre of this movie? Satire? Soft core porn? Satire of soft core porn? I’m so confused.

For a hard core DC fan, I can say that #SnyderCut is an absolute masterpiece. Landmark cinema in Superhero genre and by far the best in DC universe till now. (Pro Tip - try catching it in 4K with ANC headphones on a big screen good TV, in single sitting <U+0001F609>) Must must watch. https://t.co/igHrK7VbMD

@sleepo_jpeg Well I’d say Evangelion stayed relevant due to how it innovated the mecha genre and the psychological depth of the back half of the show and movie.

@TuchezBrian @Taylordune1 @TheLWhoLaughs @Itssan17 @Barry96567078 They are. When your Batman/Superman movie doesn't make $1 billion, you kind of messed up. Also it had the second largest second weekend box office drop in the genre and had a B Cinemascore which didn't bode well for any sequel.

@GoodBadFlicks Though a personal tragedy, along with studio politics and a somewhat fickle public, hurt him, people who liked his vision supported him, and that says a lot. Zack Snyder is the Sam Peckinpah of the comic book movie genre. #ZackSnyderJusticeLeague #SnyderCut #ForAutumn
===
@grand_velocity @H11mGuy BvS is a Watchmen-style deconstruction of the superhero genre. If you can't handle Snyder's deconstruction approach to begin with, it probably won't change your mind. But UE does improve the movie a lot. Theater cut removed a lot of interstitial material for some plotlines.

@hbomax epic isnt a strong enough word for what this movie is, an absolute masterpiece of the CBM genre and it will be talked about for years to come, a new era of epicness .

Deep Rising is the ultimate exception to a giant monster movie genre in which characters are bland and the monster has character.

Every single one of the characters in deep Rising is positively memorable from the plucky sidekick to the mercenary captain.

March 19th: THE WAILING (Amazon Prime). It's mad that we're nearly five years on and director Na Hong-jin still hasn't made a follow-up: this genre-smashing horror, a mix of MEMORIES OF MURDER and THE EXORCIST, is one of the most exciting movies of the last decade. https://t.co/PASYPpiPGC

I sat through all 4 hours of Zack Snyder justice league. I enjoyed it. Real end game vibes tho.... lol but nonetheless worth watching if you in to super hero movie genre. Too bad they haven't talked to Snyder about making more, this why D.C. will never be as good as Marvel comics

@bryanedwardhill One thing that's fascinating for me on this, Laurie Strode, Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor front, is James Cameron was so successful doing an action sequel to a last-girl horror movie, he did it again when he did a sequel to his own entry in the genre.
He pulled off both, &amp; very well

@Ser_Jon_Arryn Exactly.  There's no Marvel movie to suck all the air out of the room. Meaning ZSJL has room to be given a proper watch and also room to have its themes fairly not have its light outshown by mediocrity that's stifled growth of the Superhero genre for a decade.

Zack Snyder's Justice League - 19/03/2021

Some hero's movies never be bored of , you can watch them irrespective of the story genre. Be it flop or be it hit movies though you would be enjoyed thoroughly by watching the actor style of acting, dialogue delivery @themohanbabu garu is such among many

@BooksChatterBot @patrick_oshag “Parasite” and “1917” were both top notch. “Hell or High Water” was also a good movie for it’s genre.
===
@RecoveryAges I agree with you. I enjoy the nuances of a lost way of communicating. And the often used slang of “Tight” for drunkenness harkens back to my favorite movie genre, old Cary Grant b&amp;w comedies.

78. "Bowfinger" (1999) dir. Frank Oz
Genre: Satirical Hollywood Backstage Comedy
Why To Watch: Hollywood's hottest action star doesn't know he's starring in a wannabe director's film debut, hilarity ensues; Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy are a solid comedy pairing.

@MarissaLingen I recently realized my live action movie collection all falls into 4 categories (A) truly excellent movies, (B) hilariously bad MST3K-level movies, (C) nostalgia-flavored genre movies, (D) movies with Derek Jacobi in them, absolutely independent of quality, genre, everything.

@theymerSophie Why would we judge a superhero movie against movies completely out of it’s genre?

===
@JL_Kdiamond With Train to Busan or not (and if you like horror, it's a really good movie so you should watch it) you probably have still experienced more K movies than we have.  So I think you are fine (but seriously if you like the genre it's a horrifically fun film). <U+0001F60B><U+0001F602><U+0001F602>
===
@lauren_ash I love, in that whole movie, that that is the thing you have an issue with! I was so disappointed, I really wanted to love it. #CaptainMarvel still my favourite of the genre
===
@big_boy_berto @bleppyman @CockDAnnunzio They took out so much in the movie that couldnt be filmed— every issue came with a post-script from a different genre, exerpts from memoirs, newspapers, letters, etc
===
@benfroggo It's so weird that war has become a genre

I think one quote that keeps me thinking about this is from director and decorated war veteran Samuel Fuller who after seeing Full Metal Jacket said, "it's just another goddamn recruiting film." I disagree in ways but he has a point.

Yes!! Kingdom of Heaven Director’s Cut absolutely rips. 3.5 hours, so if you watched the Snyder cut you can’t complain about this being too long. Also it’s actually a historical epic, which is a genre we don’t get enough these days. https://t.co/xdMPdluKy1
===
If I were a famous director and someone made a “love letter” to  my films where some hack kills his idol and is then embraced by the city that scorned him, and called it a ‘comic book’ movie, I might be down on the whole genre as well.
===
@JL_Kdiamond I haven’t watched it but still talk about the K movie industry. I have no doubt the movie must be good, but I am a scaredy-cat and don’t like the horror genre.
===
@JoeR3tro @WheelsCritic @HeadExposure It's kind of sad that there's still nothing in modern superhero genre that would match Blade 1-2 fighting wise. But to have this level of action you need martial artist as a lead. I love Mahershala Ali as an actor, but Disney screwed up not getting someone like Michael Jai White
===
Newsflash: it’s not going anywhere anytime soon, beyond that, if you make a good movie it doesn’t matter what the genre is, it’s still a good movie, but it all starts with a well written, seamless story and compelling, relatable characters.
===
@kyoilys @hyekyossi__ I simply loved her in this character..  comedy genre is tough to act but #Songhyekyo is such a great actress who can pull of comedy so effortlessly.. have doubt? Watch #fullhouse and #dots . Not every one pull off comedy easily

===
@BetterCallTyler @Only_Grey @xvawes @iamthatroby Once again, not every movie is filmed on IMAX
The movie wasn't filmed on IMAX cameras or in 4:3, it's just Snyder's decision and vision, that I think it's a poor one in relation to the genre.

@JL_Kdiamond maybe its not your thing, i dont really like zombie movie either, but i watched it when it first came out because my friends asked me to tag along. and, i would say, even for me, its one of the best movie, despite the genre. it just keep you on edge
===
@JL_Kdiamond I think it’s a fabulous movie and highly recommend it but it doesn’t qualify or disqualify someone. What a silly notion. Not everyone likes that genre. <U+0001F644>

@JL_Kdiamond its a great movie <U+0001F44D><U+0001F44D> but its ok if u cant watch it due to zombie genre

@bennettfiasco You are assuming that my assessments are based on my expectations and not from just watching the movie. I like comic book movies. I love superheros. This was a perfectly fine 4 hour superhero movie. And like most in the genre, it has flaws.

Film historians will look back at the #SynderCut as the day films evolved into something new. 4-5 hour event films split into episodes will be the future of the genre. WandaVision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier may also be cited.

Sorry, movie theatres <U+0001F972>

@jbouie Honestly it played more like a clip from a snuff film. Every scene from the movie felt disconnected or tacked on. Way overhyped. Black Mass was similarly flawed (per the genre).

@Hinduone2 Dhuruvangal 16 is another Tamil movie in this genre that is very good

even overlong, memeified and potato quality visuals weren’t enough to ruin this movie because it was actually fleshed out.  if Snyder wasn’t a weirdo and made it look like shit this one would be high up on the superhero genre list

@marissadraws I do like me a good horror movie, though that genre tends to do little for me in the 30s-60s. 70s on though? Smooth sailing.

===
Zack Snyder’s Justice League is a masterpiece and a work of art. It elevates what a comic book movie can be to soaring new heights. It is the Lord of the Rings of the genre. #ZackSnyderJusticeLeague #RestoreTheSnyderVerse
===
@GeitnerSimmons Criterion curated a collection of Japanese Noir films, including Kurosawa’s High and Low. Intriguing to see how each of the director’s reworked an essentially American genre.
===
The movie keeps its tone light, almost family friendly, but its plot is solid and fast-paced. Stripped of intricate details, personality of the characters, violence and death-defying stunts, the film manages to come off as a cool genre of its own.

@nberlat it's a movie created for Fans of the DC genre, NOT for Flawed critics (as yourself).This movie is NOT the Godfather, Goodfellas, Laurence of Arabia, NO, definitely not.But it is a Love letter for fans of Zack Snyder fans. Peace <U+0001F54A><U+FE0F>. Regardless, I DO respect your opinion.

I came to movie fandom through Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, then discovered genre reading AICN every day. Used early Netflix to watch Bergman and shit. Owned The Big Sleep. I think I *wanted* to become a film snob. But in the early-mid years of parenting, I fell off a bit.
===
Synder spent 70 million to do reshoots on JL cus his vision was non-comical, hard core version of the Superheroes that I don’t think works in those genre! Was it an improve over the original yes, but was it worth to reshoot the movie no cus it was basically the same...
===
applying this logic to other media industries, should we stop consuming wholesome media from a director who has dabbled in depicting problematic tropes in a genre that is natural with these tropes? https://t.co/ZcJHUzS8BO

It's definitely among the top 5 for me(although the Nolan Trilogy doesn't count as part of the genre to me; they transcend the genre.)
===
Franchises are boring. They never assume a radically different perspective in each new movie, it's the same shit every time. The genre is more flexible than the writers/directors give it credit for.

@BooksChatterBot @patrick_oshag I was going start by saying how long is a piece of string? Patrick’s question needed more constraints such at genre etc, but this filter of most movie mentions narrows it down nicely.

Black Christmas. Fascinating slasher movie that defined a genre 4 years before it began. Intrinsically 70s in its focus on abortion, obscene phone calls, and college women slipping out of male control. Hell of an ambiguous ending, too. https://t.co/4r8fPpfext https://t.co/XlZsxf78bR

literally cannot think of any movie genre less interesting than superhero

It really took me 6 hours to watch a 4 hour movie that wasn’t in a Bollywood genre. #SnyderCut

@tcm Ignore the pseudo-politically-correct deconstructionists/"hosts", and enjoy The Searchers for its genre, its director, its actors, and its cinematography.

Never thought I would say this but @ZackSnyder created something truly great in the comicbook movie genre. #ZackSnydersJusticeLeague is not without its flaws but it does tell a compelling story, introduces interesting characters and kindles emotions like no other DC film before.

henry thought abba was a genre and the music in mamma mia was made for the movie
===
@2014joeyhillsdr the people around me, and myself when I was much younger, don't see it as a culture, they see it is a genre they can dip in and out of, like Pop. It's like they think it's there for their entertainment, like watching a movie or a TV show
===
#SoundOfViolence blends writer/director Alex Noyer’s love of the horror genre and music production, resulting in a psychological attack on the senses. My #SXSW review online now at @theAUreview. https://t.co/jGDIKBiTDK
===
But this genre has a massive popularity and is here to stay.I like what Malayalam cinema is doing here. CIA, Ustad Hotel, Trance etc all have either outright Hindi/Urdu songs or songs with exclusive stanzas in the language.
===
My favorite superhero movie is still Superman II. That was the peak of the whole genre. Never really truly bothered since then, even if I've seen a few.
===
@li0n_Fish @riseofzsjl @CutAyer Yeah and I grew up in those times. The reason we had 4:3 was because of the limits of affordable technology at the time. We also only had black and white once, so why isn’t this action/superhero movie made in black and white for artistic reasons. Because it doesn’t fit the genre!
===
@deaconpunnett @coasttocoastam One of my guilty pleasures is watching genre slasher films and your guest's movie You're Next is one of this century's best. Not for the squamish, but very good and quite scary.
===
If you'll have a role in a movie or series, what will your role be? (say for example, the genre is Fantasy)

I think I'll be an innocent looking character at first, something like the protagonist's best friend, but is actually the mastermind of the chaotic events. Or a spy. <U+2728>

@SKComics2 I'm pretty sure you thought Spider-Man 2 was a masterpiece of its genre until someone didn't start pointing out issues with it to you. It's called hype, pal. Everyone who watches the movie they enjoyed recently will think it's the best thing ever.

I thought baby G would be acting in a romantic drama or a comedy (straight).  And baby G suddenly wanted to try action genre <U+0001F923>.  but whether Ch3 and the director would let their big baby get hurt while fighting, shooting, and doing other extreme scenes? <U+0001F602> Until now I even-

Honestly I'm shocked I didn't hate this movie. It's very long has issues but what movie of this genre doesn't... It's obvious Snyder has a roadmap that he more or less planned,  the disconnect with the execs would make for a good documentary. #SnyderCut

The "zoom room rom com" is a new movie genre waiting to happen.
===
I have to admire how absolutely auteur this is, in some way. Justice League: The Zack Snyder Edition is like a Tarantino movie, if the genre he was doing a bit on was Zack Snyder movies, and Tarantino is also just Zack Snyder.
===
Honestly I feel the same about the horror movie genre. I’m glad the genre has persisted and evolved but I’m set in my ways. 

Would not say no to an Eternal Darkness remake.

I liked the #SnyderCut a lot! Not sure if I want EVERY superhero movie to be that drunk with power, but I think it’d be better for the genre if more of them were.

#BossLevel is a fun ,and action packed movie with a fun twist on the Groundhog Day genre and might I say one of the better video game movies without actually being based on any video game

I'm actually pretty excited for The Calls. Anything in the Thriller genre I love whether it is a book, podcast, or movie. BRING IT

I dunno. People seemed a lot saner when we ID'd by our choice of book genre or TV/movie genre instead of by firehydrantgender. https://t.co/BRhjPmStPy

@Playerinthgame Engrenages - (Spiral) was a series of that genre I enjoyed

"It's all one big movie—and you can't pick your genre…"
===
@lyrimia like if a show/movie brags about accuracy, and doesnt have it, sure it deserves some critique. But fantasy especially is rarely trying to be historically accurate and is a genre where one should be allowed to mix and match and create something new /because/ its fantastical
===
The true joy of silent cinema in the digital age is playing ‘baby shark’ and ‘total eclipse of the heart’ on a constant loop for every movie depending on the genre. 

Baby shark for anything serious
Total eclipse for the comedies

I don’t make the rules, I just barely follow them
===
I watched this movie recently that while comedy is the opposite of its genre there was this guy who just has no idea how to interact with children and he said a couple very funny things
===
@deiasilva10 There’s just too many characters that needed to be touched on for a single movie, but given those demands, I say it was better polished than most films with a similar genre
===
Gotta tell ya, one of the best films in this genre I've ever seen. Thoroughly entertained on every level. Wonderful performances, sharp vfx, incredible sound design &amp; a riveting soundtrack. 
A movie buff's dream. 

#RestoreTheSnyderVerse ?

Without a doubt. https://t.co/sbFKZlKwgd

It was difficult watching @snydercut knowing that we’re not getting anything out of all of that GOLD!! The movie was incredible, probably the best of its genre. There was so much setup that will die with the end credits <U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D><U+0001F62D> THANK YOU @ZackSnyder
===
stop don’t expose the “ strictly professional relationship” man. he doesn’t want to do another romance genre because he won’t have the cast and crew to thank in every video and use for every question about the movie so ofc https://t.co/iyNTdRE9f7

rate: 6.5/10
genre: comedy/drama
i pretty much enjoyed the storyline and the idea of it, but am i gonna watch it again? hmmm probably no. this movie doesn’t deliver effectively enough kayak kurang “mantap” gitu, even though it suppose to represent the asian and lgbtq+ https://t.co/5QvO7uizEG
===
@primrosechae__ Agreeee! Han Tae Sul reminds me of #ChoSeungWoo past roles. It's like having a throwback (in a good way) seeing him in #SisyphusTheMyth &amp; it still legendary. People expect that he will only do serious &amp; heavy roles. Sorry but he's not that kind of an actor who stick to one genre.
===
Hero doesn’t want to take on romance genre after After cos he doesn’t want to experience the same things he experienced with Jo, with another actress. I said what I said.
===
@SamHeughan Absolutely loved this movie! I'm a big action genre fan anyway, you hit it outta the park Sam! I already bought it and have watched it 3 times!
===
not be turning one of my friends into a bookworm with the dystopian genre and now me and two of my friends are planning to read fahrenheit 451 together then watch the movie on discord <U+0001F62D>
===
everyone always mentions “it has more content” but i never saw it this way, i just think it being released in 4:3 is a harmless way to help distinguish the movie visually from others of the genre and its own 2017 version and that makes perfect sense to me https://t.co/FCjengluf7

#ZackSnydersJusticeLeague is a piece of cinema history, that will go down in the ages as possibly the best film of the entire superhero genre. 

Thank you, Zach, for being amazing.

#ZackSnydersJusticeLeague is the best comic book movie to date. It is every DC fan’s dream come to life! @ZackSnyder you made a grand, epic, and mythological storytelling for the iconic heroes we grew up with. The #SnyderCut is unlike any other in the genre and we want more!

killer women covered in blood should be a whole movie genre https://t.co/6VQp93BaL4

@allieiswriting I love the mummy. It is a top tier movie. And it has romance and is comedic. But if asked what genre, I would say action/adventure. And that’s why I had to vote much ado here. It pained me greatly though because I love both movies so much.

thinking so hard ab how jungwons favoeite movie genre is romance. i literally can’t take this
===
BvS was a movie about how Superman getting stabbed was a consciousness-shattering tragedy of epic proportions never seen before, using imagery based on 9/11 AND Jesus. The X-Men movies have turned Holocaust imagery into a genre cliché. Why get mad because someone pointed it out.

As someone who's an aspiring filmmaker and a major geek for this genre I want to express my gratitude to @ZackSnyder for this movie which will without a doubt go down as one of the best CB Movies ever made.
===
Haven’t seen a DC movie other than Man of Steel, and not even the original Justice League, but was considering watching the new one out of sheer curiosity until I saw it was 4 HOURS!?!  The entire superhero genre is so pretentious with its overflow of content.
===
My favorite genre of movie is 90’s/00’s movies that are suppose to be serious but now read like a d-rated comedy
===
@demonsocialist @mrleandrotapia @alex_shephard That wasn't your argument. The genre and runtime isn't in question when people are watching a movie at home. You questioned the ratio when watching at home. You're conflating everything now because you have no point. You're just an asshole who hates Zack Snyder.
===
My bet’s on a “progressive” ending that criticizes the makeover movie genre... 

while still capitalizing on its appeal because, well, it’s a remake.
===
The only movie that breaches the subject of time travel in a way I can begin to grasp is Arrival and it’s not about time travel at all. And, I say all this as a person who loves the genre, adores all things Dr Who, and thinks the Christ transfiguration was not unlike time travel
