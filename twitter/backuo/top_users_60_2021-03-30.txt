The more fat you eat, the more upset your stomach, bloating, nausea, and indigestion. 

No symptoms occur with sugar. 

Stomach symptoms can be cured with antacids and baking soda. 

The most recommended is Indian goose berry.

why the fuck am i having emotions. i haven‚Äôt done anything today like? literally this is my own fault and yet!!

like idk why but putting derivatives in terms of d/dx is Very very hard for my brain to process but if u explain product rule in terms of the prime of a function suddenly i understand (e.g. "f'(x)(g(x))+g'(x)(f(x))" makes more sense to my brain than the same thing written w/d/dx)

@laazulink theyre so CUTE omg ü•∫ü•∫
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite mmm that‚Äôs definitely harder to nail down, bc Emotions, but think abt how ur feelings toward ur family (assuming a pos. r-ship) differ from those for a romantic partner; they‚Äôre no less intense, can still be described as love, &amp; involve a lot of committment
===
it can be tempting to react w/ridicule to new terms that are used by minority groups bc they ‚Äúseem silly‚Äù or whatever, but like‚Ä¶ if they‚Äôre using the term, it‚Äôs for a reason. don‚Äôt be another person who‚Äîintentionally or otherwise‚Äîinvalidates other marginalized groups.

i just need a week to stop existing but due to covid my uni decided spring break would be one (1) friday and i was running a show that weekend so it doesn‚Äôt even count like‚Äî
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that‚Äôs pretty much what goes down w/QPRs as well, but the driving feelings &amp; methodology for intensifying the r-ship will likely be different. it‚Äôs hard to verbalize the differences bc these r very closely related emotions
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite it‚Äôs like, ig the way i‚Äôd say it is ur not Craving ur QPR in the same way as u crave a romantic partner (no desire for like. kissing &amp; such, even if u do want physical intimacy ie cuddling/hugs). it‚Äôs still intense, but in a different direction, if that makes sense?
===
lrt i can't tell if it's funnier if this is pre-slowburn sangcheng w/nhs being Kind Of An Ass &amp; jc is just like. "neat." and moves on bc [REDACTED FOR ANGST REASONS] &amp; then next semester they wind up being lab partners and jc is just WAITING for nhs to suggest a study sesh,,,
===
ok i have to get to work but here‚Äôs a word of advice: it doesn‚Äôt matter if you understand a term ppl use to label themselves. that does not make it invalid or ok to joke abt. it just means YOU lack the life experiences needed to form a full understanding of the term.
===
for totally normal not-petty reasons except this Is nhs we're talking about so that never happens and jc finally snaps like "are we getting coffee or what?" and nhs is like "üò≥ how very forward of u yes let's" and jc's like "??? we have a report due?? how is any of this forward?"
===
another day of me grabbing my breakfast and forgetting to eat it until lunch has already opened
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite i think it‚Äôs the active decision to commit to a r-ship with the understanding that there will be different social expectations than with a friendship that marks the difference honestly.
===
@weiwuxiansnose i'm so sorry sugar, take care of yourself üß°üß°üß°
===
calc1 really isn't that hard but i'm finding that profs have a tendency to explain things in the most convoluted way possible
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite lol tbh i feel like a lot of ppl never really feel the need to distinguish btwn these sorts of emotions (since most ppl focus on intensifying their romantic rships rather than their platonic ones)
===
@whenasinsilks @_astrophyllite @wayofcloudbrain oh i didn‚Äôt know that!! i think the ppl i‚Äôve spoken to abt this in the past were both aro and ace, so i always assumed the lack of sexual attraction part of it üòÖ thanks for sharing!!
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that‚Äôs fine! i‚Äôm just trying to explain why QPR isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúsilly queer‚Äù way of referring to friendships, and i‚Äôve done my best to explain my understanding of the emotional differences, but i really can‚Äôt offer anything else on the matter.
===
fuck!! i need that week!!!! i need a break so i can recalibrate but i feel like i‚Äôve been set on fire and shoved off a plane and i‚Äôm so fucking mad at myself bc i can‚Äôt even finish simple tasks that are supposed to be fun and i HATE it
===
@WUJlBOT tbh it could go either way depending on exactly how uhhhhh ornery wwx‚Äôs feeling when we meet but i already got the quiet thing down &amp; enjoy absorbing energy off people lol
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite in my XP it‚Äôs in a similar vein to romantic r-ships (w/the things mentioned above involved) but lacks the romantic feelings. the name came abt bc it was coined (iirc) by aro ppl looking for ways to label their committed, unromantic r-ships. 1/3
===
this took me a while to understand (with he/him lesbians acting as the catalyst; i simply do not have the life experience to fully understand the IDs, but i can respect their decision to use these labels. i listened a LOT &amp; did my own digging &amp; developed a better understanding‚Äî
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite QPR reinforces the idea that ace &amp; aro ppl r inherently queer, and as such all of their r-ships r also queer, even when they‚Äôre platonic rather than romantic. &amp; while u can certainly think of QPRs as being ‚Äúintense friendships‚Äù i feel like doing that overlooks the nature of QPRs
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite like u can want to snuggle with family &amp; not want to wife em up, yknow? it‚Äôs just a different way of including an important person in ur life
===
i swear my eyesight‚Äôs significantly getting worse by the week
===
@vivipgri !!! what a fluffy baby!
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite oh yeah i totally understand!! i just have difficulty IDing &amp; expressing my own emotions so that‚Äôs really where my ability to help ends üòÖ realizing that period at the end makes my tone seem a lot sharper lol
===
@trixietricoter hap birth!!!!!!!!!
===
@dahliaderouge @wwxprime hello üò≥üò≥ love the dragon dick
===
@wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite (namely that they‚Äôre more involved/committed than ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù suggests). think abt friends getting married for those sick benefits &amp; being totally chill abt it w/no desire or expectation for romantic growth &amp; ur on the right track for what QPRs are 3/3
===
‚Äîbut at no point during that process would it have been ok to make fun of he/him lesbians. also: it‚Äôs primarily used by butch lesbians whose rship w/gender is very complex, &amp; no! the labels do not conflict in any way &lt;3)
===
and long story short jc doesn't realize they're literally dating until the next semester when nhs is like "icb u broke up w/me via ghosting" and jc's like "WHEN WERE WE EVEN DATING" and they both Realize‚Ñ¢
===
@GenderGriffins exactly!!!! it takes so much less energy to be like ‚Äúcool! glad that works for u‚Äù and move on with ur day üòÇ
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite aha yeah, i totally get that! unfortunately i‚Äôm not especially great at identifying or expressing my own emotions, which makes explaining it kind of difficult lol
===
@zeesongxiao np!! i think a lot of ppl get confused by QPRs bc it‚Äôs very much a nonstandard way to commit urself to another person, so i try to offer my small bit of insight when i can ‚ò∫Ô∏è
===
anyway i‚Äôm having a bad brain day so if anyone has some kind words/pics/memes to share that‚Äôd be rad (can be related to anything so long as they‚Äôre soft) üß° love y‚Äôall
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite totally valid!!! &amp; yeah i‚Äôd say there‚Äôs a distinction, but (for me) it‚Äôs pretty hard to explain it exactly lol
===
@GenderGriffins exactly!! i get very defensive of QPRs specifically bc they‚Äôre the subject of so much ridicule &amp; it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ u do realize that‚Äôs someone‚Äôs life, right?
===
i forgot what the other option in this scenario was. i got possessed by lab partners sangcheng
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that‚Äôs fine! i‚Äôm just trying to explain why QPR isn‚Äôt just a ‚Äúsilly queer‚Äù way of referring to friendships, and i‚Äôve done my best to explain my understanding of the emotional differences, but i really can‚Äôt offer anything else on the matter.
===

Like half of sub-Saharan Africa.

It was actually doing the exact opposite, even though clean drinking water was already freely available.

@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Like there's people who are your bros, kindof - you might be close or not, but primarily they're a chill hang, and you're not super involved in each other's lives. Then there's a sortof intermediate thing of being close friends, but that can be temporary, like romo relationships.
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I'm with cloudteeth - I don't really Get a difference between romantic &amp; familial feelings if you remove sex for a moment, but I like to just let that be there for the people who do. Like, I'm arospec, so.

What I absolutely do experience is a difference between Family + Friends.
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite RELATABLE

Oof

The only things I appear to actually need are "some close supportive friends" and "semi regular hugs" and "to do something about the sex drive (which does not require additional participants)".
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Oh yeah, like, being arospec I basically just assume that there IS a thing other people are experiencing and describing and like, good for them!!!

Honestly I like the word queerplatonic bc it could be a way of describing those friends-who-are-family relationships.
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes Extremely loud nodding along over here, yeah. All of my relationships have been me just getting to know someone on the normal way and then, oh huh we're in a relationship now apparently. That's nice. I will behave absolutely no differently than I would if we were close friends.
===
@wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite This confusion is basically how I determined I'm arospec. Not that it really matters, since I'm not ace and am open to relationships; I just don't seem to feel like non-sexual intimacy and commitment has two separate ways of being. Romantic friends assure me they do.
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes Except for the sex thing. I mean, basically every time I've gone in the direction of sex with a close friend it's ended up as a relationship, which seems perfectly normal to me, like, isn't that?? What a relationship IS?? Isn't that what a crush is, when you really like someone
===
@wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I've loved people deeply and intensely, and it took a friend breakup to realise the relationship tag was not required for me to feel devastated by a breakup.
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes As a potential friend and you wanna get to know them but also you think they're hot??

I hear the answer to this is No and I am *baffled* but nod along with interest at how different other people are.
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Ikr

It does feel to me like the monogamous expectation is, you're not allowed to be as close to anyone else as you are to me, whether or not you sleep with them, which. I - I'm not managing my relationships that way, sorry not sorry. Sexual monogamy is fine, but this shit? üò¨
===
@windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Once the cishets brought up the idea of "emotional affairs" and I was fully like, what the fuck are you guys ON.

I just tell people I'm polyamorous these days: it isn't entirely accurate but it does helpfully manage their expectations.
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I'm confused about the expectation that one should have only one "not actually related but definitely Family" person? Like...either I'm WILDLY romantically polyamorous, which seems unlikely, or I just don't experience a difference between platonic and romantic. So. Yeah!
===
@StoicMoonbeam @windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite Sending good thoughts (I don't really have spoons either I just can't focus on work üò≠)

Ah, another way in which I'm an anarchist. How fun!
===
@alcego_writes @wayofcloudbrain @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite But if someone sticks around long enough a bit of my brain goes, okay, you are Family now, and there's a pretty big distinction because then their presence is relevant to like my Life Decisions.

I realise this is probably what ace dating looks like, but in that case,
===
@Vorvayne @windhounded @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I wish I had the spoons to participate to this conversation because so much ‚ÄúSaaamee‚Äù for what you all just said. 
And I personally use ‚Äúrelationship anarchist‚Äù as label to express the above concepts + I explain I tend to commit intensely to the people in my inner monkeysphere.
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite yeah I say I'm poly because god, all I know about myself is that I'm DEFINITELY NOT MONO.
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes yeah my problem is that I like kissing and like...sex-adjacent stuff? but not so much actual sex. 

and I move in circles where there's a good deal of friend-kissing (and friend-sexy) stuff so the vague "romance is friends but also kissing?" idea fell right off a cliff there
===
@Vorvayne @wayofcloudbrain @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite (which is tbh how my whole system works: I describe myself as poly, aro, and ace, because you cannot expect monogamy, romance, or sex from me reliably because I may be capable of them but I don't know where the levers are, and I definitely don't NEED them)
===
@wayofcloudbrain @Vorvayne @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite (I also historically have minor meltdowns at the idea that my relationships are supposed to be *monogamous* because HOW I don't know what I DID to turn this into """a relationship""" HOW DO I KNOW I WON'T DO IT AGAIN BY ACCIDENT?)
===
@wayofcloudbrain @Vorvayne @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that confusion is also what made me decide I'm arospec but also why while I'm happy for people who are happy in queerplatonic relationships I do NOT grok what that is supposed to feel like. 

my brain slides off the idea in exactly the same way it slides off "define romance"
===
@wayofcloudbrain @Vorvayne @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite I can be in relationships but that's very much a "oh we appear to be in a relationship now, cool I guess" and I just cannot grasp the categorisation system or the idea of going looking for a specific category of relationship or what the distinct sorts of feelings are meant to be.
===
@alcego_writes it takes NO MONEY to be kind to each other. people being jerks are literally going out of their way to do it. compassion is the lazy person's way out, try it!! you'll like it!!! aren't you tired of being on a high horse???
===
@alcego_writes Eti and I were QPR for a bit and I still think that's one of the relationship types that makes my autistic demisexual self absolutely shine. It's frustrating because ppl also make fun of being genderqueer, and neopronouns, and like... it's the same thing ya dingus
===
@alcego_writes yeah like what's hard about realizing that something is important to someone else and not being a dick about it? the fact someone doesn't get something doesn't mean it therefore has no value.
===
@alcego_writes i am sorry people were butts &lt;3 the world is gross enough as it is
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite that dimension removed, i'm having a very hard time pinpointing the difference to a "merely" platonic relationship if it's *not* intensity or commitment (which it presumably isn't if there is a separate category for platonic + intense + committed)
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite or to invalidate their experiences! if anything i'm probably the alien, i'm just trying to figure out in what precise way, if that makes sense
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite ok interesting! i think i have just discovered my main problem which is that i apparently do not really understand what makes a relationship romantic. (i thought it was the wish for commitment and for playing a somewhat more exclusive role in someone's life)
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite and i'm not disputing that at all!
it's more like i'm trying to figure out why i'm having such a hard time wrapping my head around these distinctions. it all bleeds together in my head/heart. so this is really not an attempt to alienate anyone who feels this distinction
===
@Vorvayne @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite (i was sure i have been in love but who knows! i've certainly had my heart broken by *friends*, and intense, anxious friend crushes have been a thing.
i've thought that perhaps the only thing that slots my relationship into different categories is the way people respond to me.)
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite this convo is certainly making me feel like i've maybe been missing something big and didn't even know it
story of my life lol
===
@Vorvayne @alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite huh, funny. cloudy is learning something here haha. i'll go and quiz everyone i know about what they think romance feels like.
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite i feel like the issue for defining what makes a relationship "romantic" is seriously hindered by the sexual dimension that is conventionally expected to be a part of it.
===
@alcego_writes @zeesongxiao @_astrophyllite well, i'd say, for a while the difference is in a conscious wish to intensify the depth of the relationship, and gain that level of commitment; then, once achieved, its actually very much akin to familial love.
(there's also the element of sex, but i'm keeping that out of it.)
