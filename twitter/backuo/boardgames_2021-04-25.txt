I have just discovered that there's a board game where you get to play as a librarian and collect rare books and I really want to get it for my librarian friends and I to try, but it seems to be out of stock everywhere I look in the US.

Does anyone know where to find this game? https://t.co/fYGnLBjWCM

@Info_Aus I have one called Corridors Of Power; some Aussie legends turned the LNP style of governance and politicking into a board game.

Either screw everyone else or get screwed yourself. You can cooperate; but the game doesn‚Äôt specifically reward it.

@eric_lang I'd say that while I sort of agree on Pandemic, Ticket to Ride is a good gateway game...

....for introducing people to strategy games.

BUT, I agree that you don't have to introduce people to board gaming in general by using strategy games.

@zexapu I liked the kind of puzzle solving aspect of Gloomhaven but it really needs to drop the pretence of it being an RPG given how dry and mechanical  the game is.

The reason the Peach emoji is now used the way it is goes back to a video game message board (like 4chan) about Mario; they used it to reference the Princess in a sadly rule-34-ish way &amp; it caught on &amp; spread from there. It lost its association w/ Mario but kept the same meaning.

@noahsark769 Oh that's a neat idea too!
Luckily, tho, atm I have a relatively small number of mines compared to the game board size. Rn I only have 1, 9x9 board w 10 mines
ig the reason I have it like this rn is bc I want it to work for 3-4 varying board sizes, which would all have diff sets

@mahanaz_dev Also, making mineSet an actual Set instead of an Array would make the contains check faster, probably doesn‚Äôt matter if the game board isn‚Äôt millions of positions though
===
@mahanaz_dev If the number of mines to place is close to the size of the game board, it may take a long time to place the mines since each mine is likely to have a collision. Another way: put all positions in a set, then select randomly from the set and remove pos from set when mine is placed

So, yeah, @_Toukana; 3 issues.

1) Progressively more demanding requests at the same time the game asks you to enclose certain requests - regardless of current board state - makes for stressful play.

2) There's no key commands list in game.

3) There's no accessibility options.

Sanju Samson's been criticised a lot for getting out, playing a needless shot. Good to see him standing till the end and finishing the game. Important 2 points for Rajasthan as they now move to Delhi. Ominous signs for KKR and they need to get back to the drawing board.

@OrientOutlook 2/2 -  Why are are so content with possession football when others at the top play direct!ü§î for me we have fallen in to being the same old Orient from last season with no real drive and game plan. Really frustrating, just hope the board get it right for next season!! ‚≠ïÔ∏è‚Äôs

@AlHxymon @MRnice_Watch504 @_MurphyAidan @JackPosobiec What planet are you living on? When Kap took a knee ratings started to drop across the board. People don‚Äôt want to be lectured when all they want to do is watch a game. ‚ÄúNo one cares what conservatives think.‚Äù What? I‚Äôm just stating facts.

Awaiting those long promised new scoreboards at Byrd/Maryland Stadium.  

I have heard the new boards are coming this summer.  SO this might be our last football game with the 4x3 end zone video board.

@San_el_Thusi It was in 2018. West Ham were in 16th and had just moved stadiums so their fans had enough of the board basically. Several fans invaded the pitch and the fans turned their back on the game and just taunted the owners who were in the director's box

Team Boston gets on the board with a 32-yard touchdown pass from Phil Jurkovec to Zay Flowers.

Impressive toss by Jurkovec to hit Flowers in the corner of the end zone.

In this high abstract strategy game you will be placing 3d blocks out on the board, and scoring using your own 2d perspective. Check out @BoardgameBrody's video review of Block &amp; Key from @Insideupgames
