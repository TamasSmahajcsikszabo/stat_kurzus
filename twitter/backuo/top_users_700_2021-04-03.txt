Vaccine passes should not exist. This is definitely an exploitation of people‚Äôs rights and freedoms. I don't believe that vaccines can prevent the virus from spreading. Statistics show that the mortality rate of influenza is higher than that of COVID-19. #ccp #PASS https://t.co/70OqUlzZQ7

A covid vaccine passport is pointless.

@Angela68060318 @heylinM @neslihan_yeldan You are missing the point totally. The reaction to the vaccine is your immune system is getting activated ao it is learning to fight COVID-19 so it is a good thing

@Angela68060318 @heylinM @neslihan_yeldan Covid-19 is a nove virus so for the vaccine to work they need to give you a novel virus that your immue system hasnt met before. Viral vector method is how most vaccines have work for years? Conpared to mRNA of course it is traditional.

@BuckThiccland @Bigredtalk Every medication is a personal question of risk vs reward.

The purpose of COVID vaccines was never to ensure that you don't get covid at all. People just look at efficiency percentage of the vaccine and start comparing them.The sole purpose was that you don't die of the virus &amp; to decrease the chances of getting hospitalised
===
It's no big deal if you get covid positive even after getting the vaccine, you still have 5% chance of contracting the virus if the vaccine has a 95% efficiency. But chances that you will die or will be needed to be hospitalised are reduced to minimal because of the vaccine.

WVNews247: MORE THAN half a million of West Virginia's 1.792 million people now have received a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. https://t.co/e2al4JgRzu https://t.co/xWsm5BPOzV
===
@Roydini25 7 deaths is a rate of less than 1 in a two million. The COVID death rate is ~1 in 100. Blood clots have already been proven to have no link to the vaccine, and 7 blood clots in the ~20 million people who have had the AZ is far less than the number you would expect naturally

Covid-19: Seven UK blood clot deaths after AstraZeneca vaccine. I wonder how 7 out of 18m compares to death from natural blood clots, stroke, heart attack, cancer, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, road accidents, etc?! https://t.co/wcqaLGnRR1
===
@ShaneWoodhouse3 @sbattrawden Thank you for raising this, I would have hoped that you wouldn't have had to have the AZ vaccine when others are out there, and I hate that there is shaming of people who are concerned I'm prone to clots and am expecting to have to choose between Covid and a stroke...

@DethMerry @RyanKorytsky @IOHK_Charles I don‚Äôt know if he said that but he did say 92% of Covid related deaths are people 55+ so if you target that age group mortality rates plummet.

That‚Äôs true.

More people can get vaccinated if FDA allows more vaccine manufacturers to distribute in the US. Ie novavax, AstroZenica
