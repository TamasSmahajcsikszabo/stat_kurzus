Every single individual adverse reaction to the vaccine makes headlines, but nearly 600,000 deaths--including the deaths of 300 kids--and the 1 in 3 people who experience "long COVID" symptoms--including kids--barely registers at all.

It's journalistic malpractice.
===
@RyanGib64701748 @Awithonelison @DrP_MD You're arguing children are safer getting COVID--when we KNOW there are a number of negative and in some cases severe long-term health effects--than getting a vaccine, which to date shows minimal side effects in the short- or near-term.

https://t.co/GxkBv8UUDu

Whites think by the color of their skin entitles them to claim America. Look at the woman from Ukraine who was asked to mask up but went off, randomly, on a Muslim sis instead. Good cop set her straight &amp; arrested her.

I was the only kid in my class who didn't stand for the Pledge. Or the school anthem. I played the outcast, but I had many friends. I trolled the teachers and got good grades. I partied in college and dropped out before the finals. I wore the mask for 12 months when no one else

did in my town. Now I don't wear the mask.
I must be a horrible person.

You know anti-vaxxers/COVID sceptics have no point to argue when they *deliberately* go out of their way to watch your TEDx talk, just to make a point about ‚Äúsurrounding ourselves with others‚Äù.

@forsale1818 Right?? I don‚Äôt get it. Especially people listening to Tucker Carlson who‚Äôs saying you should berate people FOR wearing a mask. Going as far as calling CPS on kids wearing masks. These people want to be victims so bad it‚Äôs insane.

@almaforarizona @pfizer Got thing you continued to wear a mask, social distance and wash hands thoroughly. So what did you really not do that you aren't telling us? And if you did do everything right, then why should anyone who has been fully vaccinated still wear a mask? Sounds like control tactics.
===
Day 411. Put on a dress shirt with loose sleeves and the fancy mask to get vaccinated.
===
@ChaitanyaTOI can we fight against corona earlier as if we dont get vaccine properly? sad to hear that covid vaccination center is been shut for 3days because of shortage.
===
@jultar1000 @x3r0h0ur @GoffRokkit @SecondGentleman I wasn't clear - I meant I hope you don't get COVID. I'm sorry to hear the vaccine may not be an option. I have general anxiety disorder &amp; treatment resistant depression. Both can be brutal. I finally found effective treatment so I'm getting there. Stay safe.
