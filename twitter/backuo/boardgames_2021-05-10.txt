It truly does feel like we're sitting pawns in a chess game between powerful actors. They can see the entire board and they know the endgame. But we can only see the boxes in front of us and our colleagues disappearing around us. Just a feeling ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

@HardTacc @Beykick125 @amchenry00 @MythicGamesMG Looks to me like the M1014. But were also talking about the company who made an operation called "Crimson Heist" without a bank rework. Pretty sure this board game company aren't Ubi as well
===
@HardTacc @Beykick125 @amchenry00 @MythicGamesMG Look. Use your common sense. They're similar guns. It's a plastic figurine for a board game. Its kapkan. It doesnt take a genius to know that it really isnt an MPX that hes holding.
===
@HardTacc @Beykick125 @amchenry00 @MythicGamesMG Nor do I get how this spiralled into this. I'm not necessarily grumpy, I'm just so confused to the logics behind it. Like on further detail it may look more like the MPX, but at the end of the day, it also looks like the VSN. It's a board game with a little plastic figure.
===
@Kenjimeistor @Beykick125 @amchenry00 @MythicGamesMG I'm not going into it because I just have on 2 different threads and its hurting my brain, but please use common sense. Its kapkan. It looks enough like a 9x19. It's a board game figurine. It's the fuckin 9x19VSN.

@Zavvannahh @Beykick125 @amchenry00 @MythicGamesMG But the MPX is a real life gun! And it's in the game, on Valkyrie and Warden! In game, Kapkan gets a Vityaz, so the board game isn't accurate to the Video Game. That's the argument.

It's been about 6 months since I played a strategy board game and I have been having cravings. Part of it is craving that unhurried time, set aside for being in the company of friends. Part of it is the cards, the board, the wooden pieces... Perhaps after May 17th we can game!

@TheTwinSunzPod @PlayRuneterra Neat thought, but unlikely. They've generally said that they want the game to be offense-oriented and always advancing towards a conclusion, so they try to limit board states that naturally punish your opponent for attacking.

@GailSimone I used to play board games with a dude who was infallible, in that every board game he lost was a result of bad luck or an unbalanced gameplay experience. He would essentially just try to argue after every game why the game was bad.

So, he stopped getting invited back.

@drunkymelon @Colts The Steelers will be a fluke just like last years playoff game. Defensively speaking the talent is not even close to what Indy will line-up across the board. The Bills had their run, last year yes they matched up better. This year not the slightest, and the browns lack talent
===
@drunkymelon @Colts 5. We drafted two of the best edge rushers on the board, period. Lastly if you watched our bills playoff game, clearly Phillip rivers overthrew Pittman twice. One for a TD and the other on the last 4th down play. A SLANT route wide open if you may.

@posthumouspoems what's like a cool fun board game i assumed they all were bad but i may reconsider
===
@brickk @IHeartFargo But board games aren't too much different‚Ä¶ Oftentimes, they'll lean on player familiarity with the genre, both to shortcut rules explanations and even to spark interest in the game in the first place. ("This is your classic hand-management worker placement game, but in space!")
===
@brickk @IHeartFargo Regardless, both suffer from assuming knowledge that can't be treated as a given ‚Äî unless you're expressly pitching it as such. It's a bit of a grey area for me, but I do think it can be okay for a game (whether board or roleplaying) to say it's catering to "people who've done X"
===
@IHeartFargo @brickk This is a real shame üòî I do lots of board game stuff, and playtesting there seems to be MUCH more rigorous. Not only is there testing of play, but there's fully blind testing to get feedback on rules parsing, rulebook clarity, even components reinforcing rules. RPGs‚Ä¶ are babby.

@JayWamsted @demarquetry It's a good point. I'd love to see just 30-45 more mins so days weren't so hectic, so kids got more than 10 mins to eat lunch, so recess was a bit longer.

@daltonjgoodier Twilight Struggle is considered one of the best board games of all time and is a 2 player competitive cold war game. Onitama is a 2 player more chess-like experience. For cooperative there's almost too many options, Pandemic Fall of Rome, Eldritch Horror, or Robinson Crusoe.

@Cashflow26 @amur_minerals @FitchSolutions Robin Young and many of the board took shares in lieu of wages for a very long time and he has just under 6.5 million so their interest are aligned with shareholders. It is just a waiting game now until takeover and I believe this could be closer than we think due to the silence.

The core of the game, and what made it interesting, was the impossible board, and that within the game itself, you had a seemingly infinite set of equipment to pick from and use.

The fictional game combined aspects of D&amp;D and traditional board games, really.

@TheQueen0Spades Video game RPGs are just boardgame simulators at their core. If they aren't simulating role playing, then it's not an RPG. Levelling systems and skill point allocation are mechanics that get slapped onto every directionless AAA game like crafting is. It doesn't make them RPGs.

@DrGregVR They can add more, but they will not make it a deeper experience. Demeo is a fundamentally awesome intro to VR board games, but for those left asking "ok, what next", pointing out Tabletop Simulator and some of the amazing games available there, or TTRPG, would be apt.
