@MWDanvers glad you are OK. I was a little worried when I didn't see you the other day, but figured you needed space. :)
===
@joshadams Reference of the inside of a pocket?
===
@joshadams crap that can mean only one thing.... you're drawing the Micronauts :P
===
I hear @GailSimone was disappointed with Godzilla vs. Kong because there wasn't enough Kaiju taint
===
Freedom is the right of all sentient beings! https://t.co/qqUq51Iz5s
===
@NickRoche Might I recommend Studio 86 Rodimus..... Also MAstermind Creations has some awesome IDW inspired bots.. (I have 3 Calidus aka not-Rodimus). https://t.co/ct24Dx8a3C
===
I am this years old when I realized that Pirates of Dark Water had.. 0 white heroes. It's such a great series too.
===
@JimZub It is screen rant. They aren't exactly.. good at comics stuff. They get stuff wrong all the time.
===
@thesteveorlando I have none of these stories cause I went through a drive-thru vaccination and there was no out except getting the shot lol.
===
@NickRoche you are in for a treat. :) I'm excited for you.
===
For the first time in over a decade, I have sunglasses that aren't brown or grey... they're purple.. and they're transitions.. And I'm so in love.
===
@gmcalpin I'm not a big enough movie buff to know.. and I only ever see screenrant stuff for comics since that's something I care about.. and they're wrong a lot.. then again, so are the comics news sites.
===
@GailSimone he is absolutely a Raccoon. his name is supposed to be ROCKET RACCOON. stupid movies,... ugg https://t.co/OqncQfUO7m
===
@joshadams Nope.. tell @IDWPublishing that you're doing Micronauts now.. :P it's officially official.
===
@jtlevy @PJTMtl @ManueleKevin @neilhimself I could never hunt down all of the Gross written issues.. so I am getting the Omnibuses. Also I just like reading that way these days. So much easier. Everything is in order and easy to find lol
===
@PJTMtl @ManueleKevin @jtlevy @neilhimself Fyi there is a Books of Magic omnibus out now that has the first 4 Gaiman/Bolton mini then the first 32 issues of the on-going by Ney Reiber and Gross that show Tim growing up with vast magical powers... Great series.
===
@GenderGriffins I'm not a fan!!!

@GenderGriffins That is very tempting indeed. I have to teach today, in theory, and I'm just like -- why do I get bad news on a day when I'm teaching the rise of fascism, whyyyyyy
===
@publicetienne: u have to watch word of honor so we can scream about it together

pls open for full effect https://t.co/huMG2m0Lk2 https://t.co/nVVAN33W0C

how do adult humans with jobs and taxes go about finding roleplay partners... i either made friends as a teen or i have been romantically involved with all my rp buddies since like 2004. is there a match dot com for fandom rp. do i need to upload a cv.
===
@quinnscarlett13 some people have tried to implement the stack thing but most people don't even bother :(
===
@cloudy_recesses dflksdmflskdfm how is this more than a year old and i am only now perceiving it??
===
@munin_and_hugin it's such a good gender!
===
@kika988_ Oh man talking to strangers... what if I just peer pressure my friends into rping with me so I don't have to be shy and awkward 🤔🤔
===
still wondering this... if u are a moot of mine and ever want a no-pressure rp feel free to reach out :) https://t.co/oUrflh2o39
===
as a present to myself, trans boya DOES NOT have any gender dysphoria or body dysmorphia. sometimes he's like man titties what's up with that but then goes about his day. a bigger dick would be nice but then everyone would know when he's Secretly Consumed By Lust
===
@Vorvayne @whenasinsilks @philologicalbat @txj666 it's also a fun game to show me pictures of people and ask me who they are! guaranteed wrong-yet-somehow-right answers only
===
[work] today for the trans day of visibility i am presenting on lgbtq topics for [profession]! i am nervous but also excited :) :)
===
hello friends... it is april 1 but there will be NO JOKES and NO TRICKS on this twitter! this is a safe space where no one has to feel like a fool. (i am happy to provide puns though should you still feel festive)
===
@westiectweets i'm glad!!!! characters are good!!!
===
[work] HR just reached out to my trans activism group and said thank u for your work on tdov and every day ;-----;
===
TRANS HEADCANONS FOR TRANS DAY OF VISIBILITY GET 'EM WHILE THEY'RE HOT https://t.co/bQrk6aiWJD
===
i would also ask that if u are feeling festive to remember that some of us can be v upset by surprises and tricks even if they are meant well! tagging ur post with april fools or otherwise indicating it is A Joke can go a long way to helping ppl not get spooked :)
===
also for the trans day of visibility may i present to you

trans
masc
boya

who has been living in my head nonstop and being rp'ed with eti but may actually appear in a threadfic or ficfic soon
===
here is an example of a good joke:

for april fool's day i went out of my way to pet a dog

PSYCH

i pet TWO DOGS!!!!
===
@Vorvayne @whenasinsilks @philologicalbat @txj666 i try to only give correct takes even if i do not know whomst i am taking
===
@tomatoflowers I've never really been able to get into dreamwidth but i LOVED livejournal roleplay Back In The Day.. maybe it's just time to make the switch. At this point I'm still in Boya hell but I would absolutely do CQL with anyone.
===
@tux_kate the universe likes to be on the nose about things sometimes &lt;3
===
@ghost_houses @publicetienne i don't have any room for anyone but boya rn, but the brainrot from woh is encroaching on every visible space in my environment and i fear it is only a matter of time
===
@tux_kate i am working from home today if you want to be aggressively online WITH me
===
@JudiWench That’s me!!!! I am a griffin!!!!
===
@drawinthelynes omg! you look so happy!!!
===
(i think this is what i crave most from trans headcanons, is having the opportunity to create a scenario where trans trauma is optional.)
===
trans boya is also a kinky sadomasochistic bastard who comes into his own under the gentle tutelage of qingming, who in this verse has mild shapeshifting abilities and is just like. what body do u want me to have bb. it's just not even remotely an issue for either of them.
===
@kat8cha1 I've never really seen twitter RP! I am already thinking of doing a fandom DW account so maybe I will poke around there
===
also for folks who are autistic or take things literally or are learning the language you are tweeting in, explaining jokes (even ones that seem obvious) can go a long way to helping ppl feel included! some of my bad april fools day feelings are being excluded from the fun.
===
[work] one my of coworkers is extraordinarily shy and uses the chat to communicate during meetings. sometimes gets overlooked, so i've taken to going EXCUSE ME... MY FRIEND HAS A QUESTION... THANK U and just glaring at the camera until they get the point. do not ignore my friend!
===
@tomatoflowers I'm glad that's still going on! I still remember the summer of 2006 as being a blast with ljrp and forum rps. That was before I even had a FB, I feel so old lol
===
@gazatron13 @GlennLilley03 @RyanJShaw94 @Flakes1979 That kinda screws you over if you need a tradesman to come fix something though. And I don't think anyone wants a road to be blocked just because someone is getting their weekly shop delivered.
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline Oh, I respectfully disagree. I think that the Maquis led to some good storytelling with how you maintain evolved ideals in less than evolved circumstances. 

(And whilst I have a lot of respect for GR, his vision of evolved 24th century humans often made for dull characters.)
===
@_WHarry_ @SunApology "I don't think I'd have dabbed much below year 10".

Year 10 has 14 year old.
He says "much".

Translation: he would have only tried to shag "a few" 13 year olds but would have mainly focused on older teenagers.
===
@bermlee @JonfuciusOnline I can't remember, was it supposed to be uninhabited and the Maquis were pretending that they weren't there? That's a (little) bit better.
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline No, I mean that everyone in Star Trek made disparaging remarks of other races. Sisko's comments about the Ferengi were the same as those made by Picard or Riker or Worf or Kira or Bashir. But Quark was allowed to argue back with Sisko.
===
@Squirrel_Walker I think the only white leader was Eddington? Their leader in their first appearance was black. And there's Chakotay and his non-specific Native American-ness.

(And Edington being leader was more an accident of making up stories on the fly rather than anything pre-planned)
===
@Squirrel_Walker That's fair. But I also think they don't map 100% on to "displaced Native Americans". Most Trek takes the metaphor as a starting point and the  grows it. And I imagine that if you're creating a terrorist group you're walking a line over not offending people one way or the other.
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline You could argue that when he was put in charge it was a dead-end assignment in the middle of nowhere for a guy whose career had burned out. I don't think Starfleet especially cared before the wormhole appeared. But that's an in-universe explanation.
===
@Squirrel_Walker It's why the Native American thing doesn't work as a perfect metaphor. The settlers didn't force them out of their homes because they were trying to avoid a war with, say, Austria. It's probably closer to Versailles as "bad treaty with bad side effects".
===
@Squirrel_Walker I always got the impression that the Cardassian war was fairly one sided. Whilst it may have been a "war" to them, to Starfleet it was more like a border skirmish. Which explains why no-one mentioned it for 3 and a half seasons on TNG.
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline I don't see DS9 being a frontline to oncoming war or diplomacy. It wasn't Babylon 5. Before the wormhole the only reason you'd have to go there was to trade with a post-occupation Bajor that was barely hanging on. It was a backwater. (Not to the Bajorans obviously, as Kira says.)
===
@JonfuciusOnline Like, DS9 usually put the effort in to showing the sort of morally dubious decisions good people can make in war and how that can affect them, but that ending was just "whoops lol".
===
@CarolineMack18 @IvyMcCat @UnrankedBadger @robinince Yes, but that's irrelevant. Labour started that war. If the Tories had been in power they would have started that war. On that issue there was no difference between them.
===
@GlennLilley03 @_CLPhotography @gazatron13 @GRR94 @RyanJShaw94 @Flakes1979 And then we loop right back to "this law will punish poor people who don't have adequate parking space"

(I do also agree that we shouldn't block pavements so I dunno the solution.)
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline The thing that struck me was that he had 3 love interests in the show (his old wife, his new wife, and whatever was going on in Second Sight) and they were all black because obviously we can't have the black lead go out with a white woman at any point.
===
@mippy @scousepie His school needed more bullies so that he'd be better at fighting of bullies.

With conkers, probably.
===
@IvyMcCat @CarolineMack18 @UnrankedBadger @robinince Unfortunately, he's still the only Labour (or Labour-assigned) politician that's had any success for the past four decades. I think the hanging him up as a boogeyman doesn't help Labour address any of its internal issues.
===
@Michael_French As long as she's seen the "you wouldn't steal a CAR" video then you've done all you can as a parent.
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline I'm not sure there's a real world equivalent for "pretend to be your dead parallel universe self and make sure your securely aggressive partner doesn't fund out to stop the evil empire from making a genocide weapon", but I can see that point...
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline I'm not sure how much that applies to locations in space, but Trek often has an odd idea of how big space is to begin with.
===
Because apparently a man getting a woman pregnant and then leaving her to raise the kid alone is all the woman's fault. https://t.co/WvUpFvr4iN
===
@Squirrel_Walker I thought it was an interesting storyline... how are the "little people" affected by decisions made for arguably good reasons at a government level. Avoiding a war is good. People being forced to abandon their homes is bad. What happens when those two factors collide?
===
@JimboS1993 @RyanSays1984 @E_Beardmore Two things:
Why do you think no-one plays conkers or bulldog anymore?

And are you saying that there should be more bullies at school?
===
@SamuraiPizzaRob @GriddleOctopus @bonzrat I have a friend who loved that there's a pre-watershed version of Taskmaster so that they can watch it with their kids.
===
@hildabast @VgaMaths @GidMK @TheAtlantic I suspect it'ds be like saying "can't we just get everyone involved in building airplanes to just make trains instead?"
===
@JonfuciusOnline I love that episode, but that ending is really weird.
Dax: So, did you tell Starfleet before you used chemical warfare to do a warcrime on a planet?

Sisko: https://t.co/mcokqaBZZY
===
@VgaMaths @hildabast @GidMK @TheAtlantic Money will always be an issue. It varies by country, but roughly the AZ jab is $3 a dose compared with the Pfiezer at closer to $20. If you're planning on vaccinating millions of people, that's a huge difference.
===
@malattia87 @hiimginger @Hypercortical @jessjones327 @spraldredge @stump_water Wow, so edgy.
===
@hyc_symas @weseire @ClownTrousers Well, a typical American light bulb. 😁 I think our LED lights are about 7W.

And to be fair, I think most people working long term from home are likely to get at least a monitor as well. And there's heating and/or AC as well.
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline Although I love Kasidy Yates so I'm not gonna argue too strongly about that.
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline I disagree. Look at the staff: the engineer is a non-com, Sisko was two steps away from resigning, the chief science officer was only a lieutenant and probably only there at Sisko's request, and the CMO was a wet behind the ears graduate who made clear it wasn't a glamorous post.
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline Okay, I'm gonna have to ask about the racist, misogynistic and rapist claims.
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline ...but it terms of racism, I don't see that Sisko is especially different from literally everyone else in Trek making disparaging and stereotypical comments about other races.
(He's definitely a bit racist towards Ferengi, but he's also called out on it.)
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline (That should be "sexually aggressive partner")
===
@LochgellyDL @hildabast @VgaMaths @GidMK @TheAtlantic I guess a worry going forward is that the blood clot issue with the AZ vaccine only became apparent after several million doses were given out. So it's potentially naive to pin your hopes on a "superior" alternative that might also have an extremely rare side effect.
===
@housetoastonish @scousepie It was banned earlier in Scotland due to, I dunno, socialism or something. Also Bulldog was called Kiltrun and bullies had to be imported from Wales.
===
@Squirrel_Walker Well, that, and also the Cardassians weren't invented until season 4. But it does make early season 1 with the constant "we are evolved humans who have moved beyond war and famine and petty desires" look fairly hypocritical if there's supposed to be a war going on at the time.
===
@MastersRich @JonfuciusOnline I think the difference is that every time Sisko did something "morally grey" (to be charitable) the show was usually at pains to show that greyness. Hell, that entire episode was about the morality of doing bad things to get good outcomes, and you felt that he lived with that.
===
@MastersRich @JonfuciusOnline There are three James's, basically. Pillar's unsure captain who just wants to do science, Taylor's maternal commander, and Braga's inflexible badass. (With some fluidity between writers.)
===
@ChristyChambe77 @IndieWire But it's not like those jobs won't exist. They'll just happen somewhere else.
===
@Squirrel_Walker @JonfuciusOnline I guess Through The Looking Glass maybe counts for "rapist"? I dunno. Mirror Universe episodes are so ridiculously horny I'm not sure normal rules apply.
===
@CarolineMack18 @IvyMcCat @UnrankedBadger @robinince Thank god all the Tory MPs at the time voted against it then, eh?
===

Adjacent recommendation (scripted, but mockumentary-style): Review With Forrest MacNeil. Watch it in order, and you'll be VERY rewarded by the end.

Bad Trip is so goddamn funny, and I completely forgot what it's like to watch non-political hidden-prank comedy! I really miss Nathan For You. https://t.co/PA38zQaT0V

@soupness @BoardGameGran It's still available! Steam is IGNORING the Classification Board (but who knows for how long?). If you're gonna grab it, get it NOW

@VitruvianGamer @ElKobold Imagine if you had to roll a check for every facet of your internal monologue. It's great haha.

@markh110 Only $200 can do that. 
200 bits = rewind 1 minute
$20 = rewind 10 minutes
$50 = Start movie from the start
$84 = Handwrite out the opening scene 
$200 = Turn off the movie for 5 minutes - but then start the movie from the start.
$500 = Watch WW1 and WW84 back to back.

@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline He made an entire planet uninhabitable! That ought to have been the end of all their careers and a Federation-wide scandal. If Worf disobeyed, that would have made an interesting continued story.
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline The scene in question. Everyone just follows orders, which is probably justifiable dramatic stakes, but what if Worf complicated matters by not firing?

https://t.co/wuX2gFz2DZ
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline I think since the original deal was that the Federation wanted the colonies in the DMZ vacate in the first place it might have been justified, but now we have displaced colonists and a whole M-class biosphere ruined.

Your labels and terminology can change. It doesn't make you less valid. 

I'm still figuring all of it out. I hope y'all have the safely and space to do so as well.

Happy #TransDayOfVisibility friends. 

Gender is weird &amp; I'm still trying to figure out what feels authentic to me... but I am nonbinary. I usually ask that people use she/they pronouns but am mostly pronoun indifferent.

===
@fFi5hey Great comic!😂
===
OMG!! I’m in LOVE with Umbra Via! The mechanics are CLEVER in this pretty blind bidding and tile placement game. Having that extra bit of info from 2 rounds of bids before checking who wins tiles is PURE *chef kiss*🥰 Plus, the 2p game is super FUN! Gonna play so much of this🖤 https://t.co/DP4BMyYGMJ
===
@BoardGameGran Thank you!!💖 I wish it was only one. I keep battling these comments pretty regularly and it’s only increasing😅
===
Trans Rights are Human Rights! Let’s be visible with love &amp; support for our trans family!🏳️‍⚧️💖🤍💙🏳️‍⚧️

@TabletopiaGames HAHAHAHAHA!! I mean I’m down with thissss!
===
@SoloPlaythrus That’s a great response!

@beforeyouplay_ Thanks!! I’m so glad I’ve got y’all to relate to. My videos may *look* easy, but they definitely aren’t lolol💖
===

@OrigamiGoblin @Pandasaurusgame @connorjwake Awe! Thank you!!💖
===
@MeepleOverboard Agreed! I love it at 2p!! This makes me wanna play rn😋
===
@The7thStick @madeIeina @LeFraudExposed @LilNasX Hope you don’t get free from England
===
@geekygaymerguy I honestly do not understand the point of leaving mean comments like this. I mean, someone made the effort to write, film, and edit the video for us to watch for free and then someone else wants to criticize?
===
@geekygaymerguy If I ever lose those off my most used, I’m just going to give up and go lie down and die in a field somewhere
===
@geekygaymerguy Your content is great and I really enjoy it. And I think “petal” is a better word than I would have probably used in my video. Haha. Keep doing you Theo!
===
@beforeyouplay_ @geekygaymerguy I don’t think anyone’s videos are easy now that I do them. Recording, editing, and everything else that goes along with it. For me it’s all while managing a life, working full-time, being a husband, and a dad. But you guys all put out amazing content and are just as busy.
===
@beforeyouplay_ @geekygaymerguy Agreed. An lack of sleep!
===
@beforeyouplay_ @geekygaymerguy I can’t even count the times I’ve broke night having to record and edit with the little was sleeping to then get ready for work. I think every creator can relate.
===
@geekygaymerguy Sounds like it’s time to get out your blocking finger https://t.co/hHEwtVKxCD
===
@LobbyofHobbies @geekygaymerguy You have a lot on your plate! It’s true, I think making content in general is waaaaaay harder than it may seem to a lot of people. It’s easy to consume content and criticize but a lot of people don’t realize all of the hours, brain space, planning, and resources that went into it
===
@geekygaymerguy PS, people have no idea how difficult it is to make videos!
===
@geekygaymerguy Oh goodness. Well, “furthermore” is one word! People are ridiculous. You do you, Theo! 💜💜💜
===
@LobbyofHobbies @geekygaymerguy YES. THAT. CONSTANTLY.
===
@geekygaymerguy There's always that one person Theo. You're wonderful, they're pedantic.
===
@beforeyouplay_ @geekygaymerguy Bless you.. right?!
===
@geekygaymerguy Most of mine are lovely, but every now and again I get a terrible one (my voice stinks for example). I'm trying to get better at not letting them get to me, but it is tough. I just don't publish them.
===
@markh110 I was asking for @VitruvianGamer I hadn't actually even heard of it. Now I know that even if I had I wouldn't be able to get it because it's banned here in Australia.
===
@geekygaymerguy NEW PHONE, WHO DIS? BEEETCH
===
@geekygaymerguy @RavensburgerNA @PencilFirst @trzewik It's SO GOOD RIGHT?!
===
@geekygaymerguy Those are millennial emojis - you're team Gen Z now!
===
@geekygaymerguy There is no vaccine for pedantry.

@A_TypicalQueer @ShineyPen @MekoRios @TabiHastings @Kerusaurus That's when I get free!
===
@A_TypicalQueer @TabiHastings @ShineyPen @MekoRios @Kerusaurus I wish I had seen this coming, I sent in my app a couple hours ago, and would have loved more eyes on it.
===
@A_TypicalQueer @ShineyPen @MekoRios @TabiHastings @Kerusaurus Oh shoot, I read that as today not tomorrow, I feel silly.  Tomorrow I am streaming at 9 x.x
Y'all are gonna be Amazing though, I know it!
===
@markh110 @ElKobold That's a great idea! I like that!
===
@geekygaymerguy Haha, it's crazy right? 😅
===
@beforeyouplay_ @geekygaymerguy So true!
===
@MekoRios But, what are the colors? xD
===
@MekoRios I went to eat up my burrito and forgot the packaging has paper on the outside,  but aluminum on the inside. 🤣
===
@geekygaymerguy I have some pedants in ny local game group. I purposefully call components by wrong names just to screw with them 😁😆
===
@JanArrah @PJTMtl @ManueleKevin @neilhimself Really one of my favorites of the 90s. (But I have all those issues in original TPBs already, as well as the single issues.)

@geekygaymerguy I know this pain

@A_TypicalQueer @MekoRios @froggyvoid oh hell yeah i’m game

@MekoRios i bought them specifically for T and i love them sm

@geekygaymerguy Miserable people seek to make others miserable, so they’re not alone.

Don’t give them the free rent.

The rest of us know what a great content creator, and wonderful human being, you really are. ❤️

@MekoRios your internet friends need you more

@A_TypicalQueer @MekoRios @TabiHastings @Kerusaurus I feel like I throw everything off with timing lol. Today would've been perfect since I'm off but tomorrow I can be free after 6pm pt unfortunately

@ZaeyllaTV @Peer2PeerLive @Mothmageculpa @AnnieMayPlay @epolight @MekoRios @ChaoticTabris omg... thank you for thinking of me 🥺💙

@A_TypicalQueer @TabiHastings @MekoRios @Kerusaurus Um.. yes?? Okay please?
===
@geekygaymerguy Some people are just asshats...
===
@GenderGriffins I ammmmm and I'm hoping ur doing swell too ! 🥰🥰💕💕
===
@GenderGriffins oh gosh yeah, i think 2006 was like the very first time I rped on lj....remember dressing rooms and writing apps with samples that mods looked over if you claimed a character from a fandom?? what a wild time!
===
@GenderGriffins Same; I was in ljrp games and everything! I'm sure if you posted on entries by a comm like bakerstreet you'd find some people! I've seen a ton of CQL but I've seen other cdramas too, and that was months ago.
===
@GenderGriffins Tbh I just see if I vibe with people on meme posts on dreamwidth...I made two friends like that rping lwj and lxc! But making dw journals is a lot of work!
===
@GenderGriffins Also valid 😂😂 I do like the anonymous aspect of Omegle in that yeah, they may be strangers, but because it’s 100% anonymous people skip through quickly and there’s no “sorry this isn’t what I want” and you get to choose if you want to offer contact info or not
===
@GenderGriffins I've only ever been able to find RP partners on Omegle, which is.......... not ideal but at least makes it easy to cut and run with no weird social extraction methods if you don't mesh well
===
@GenderGriffins I mean, ye olden LJ days there were all sorts of communities. Maybe DW has some? Or make an RP twitter and see what bites?
===
@markh110 Well I guess I have to now.
===
Root canal done, Boston Market mac and cheese acquired, &amp; sipping on this tea! Streaming tomorrow for the Tales of Olympia at 2pm CST with @dammit_cat1, @MekoRios, &amp; @SomaTheGaymer https://t.co/1IRoJ1zB7R

When, exactly, was this? 

You don't put your questions into any context.  Germs are the first hypothesis when dealing with a rapidly spreading disease.  And it was correct.

@geekygaymerguy Thank you thank you! We’re certainly excited to have our own space and maybe even built a set, although it won’t be as beautiful as yours

@A_TypicalQueer @ShineyPen @MekoRios Oooooo I'm so happy I'll be applying with y'all 💜

@hildabast @LiamKav @VgaMaths @GidMK @TheAtlantic What a wonderfully casual dismissal given the obvious difference in evidence base when comparing approved and in use with un-approved vaccines. And if you are looking forward mebbe consider post-pandemic pricing :)

@geekygaymerguy lol why bother with jargon if it makes the review harder to follow
===
@geekygaymerguy By my count, you didn't say petals at 3:41. At the start you introduce them as sakura petals, then say petals immediately after to remove all ambiguity.
Thanks Joe 👍
===
@A_TypicalQueer @MekoRios @shadocoon @froggyvoid This needs to happen like now!
===
@A_TypicalQueer @MekoRios @shadocoon @froggyvoid I'd watch that!

@GenderGriffins good luck!! 💗
===
@geekygaymerguy @StrongholdGames Not Alone is spectacular. Pretty good even at low counts too! We don't know much about the other game. Have fun!

Glad to hear you got your shot! Mom's and Kid's should be soon, thankfully.

@emmalovehaz @ireneinterlude HELP

@geekygaymerguy @StrongholdGames So excited to play the Sanctuary expansion!

@ireneinterlude Green❤️
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline but, to be fair,, it was a super dick move for Starfleet to put him in command of a politically relevant station, and not promote him to capt. right away

Even back then it felt like a race thing on tv
===
@LiamKav They, and hear me out....didn't have to make a terrorist group, out of people fighting for their homes
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline That station, even before the wormhole was super important to Starfleet cause it meant taking charge in what was the space of a former enemy, and a frontline to oncoming war, diplomacy, etc. DS9 was a big political chip for Starfleet's expansion...Sisko wasn't a has-been to them
===
@LiamKav It didn't get a lot of traction on TNG because TNG wasn't suppose to be serial. 

Also, a war keeps people in one place, and Picard's mission was to explore
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline So Sisko is so not racist, he got called out on being racist

There was intolerance in Star Fleet, but Sisko barely tried to get along with anyone that didn't worship him.
===
@LiamKav At the beginning, the Maquis were more diverse, but that quickly changed
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline Just remembered Tim Russ wasn't a Maquis on DS9, but Tim was in so much Trek as different people
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline Think about it this way....Guam is DS9. After America took Guam after the war, how well do you think it was set up? It wasn't, but Guam is still, even though it doesn't seem like it, an extremely important thing for America to have and hold for defense, but we don't fund it
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline Yes, and, they count. Mirror Universe characters are acting to their characterization, but Sisko wasn't Mirror...he chose to do what he did

I'll take the misogyny out, but the racism stands. If you weren't human or bajoran....Sisko had a lot of vocal opinions
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline That was actually how war take overs happen. An officer is dispatched to take control of the new territory, and are given next to nothing...this is very common, and why lower officers get it...They have proved themselves, but if it fails, it was all their fault (scapegoated)
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline It makes sense when you realize that whole Maquis thing was suppose to be an allegory for displaced Native Americans (TNG), and then quickly turned into, 'but what happens when it happens to white people', as the on screen leaders were shown to be mostly white, except this guy https://t.co/lVBDkWkMyj
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline All of the Maquis stuff was the worst part of Star Trek. It was a big stain on the universe, I think. It was something, so against Gene's vision

If they didn't do any of that...I would have liked Sisko more in the end
===
@geekygaymerguy I mean, it's no worse than another kind of poke 😁. Congrats! Just got mine today too.
===
@LiamKav @VgaMaths @GidMK @TheAtlantic Health authorities' surveillance &amp; recommendations aren't based on vax cost. (For context: AZ vaccine is mostly somewhat higher than that: one or perhaps 2 vaccines so far cheaper globally. J&amp;J bit more expensive per shot, but costs of vaccinating much less as only one needed)

@madeIeina HELP YOURE SO HAPPY ABOUT IT IM CRYING
===
@madeIeina yep i just saw it lmaoo
===
@madeIeina WHAT HAPPENED
===
@madeIeina i’m guessing the 10th, bc that’s prolly when heaven press season starts
===
@madeIeina i been waiting on the chance to see this one fr it looks fly
===
@Vorvayne @philologicalbat @txj666 @GenderGriffins ha! i mean. that's not WRONG

making my wen kexing fanmixes involved robbing my huaisang and yllz fanmixes blind, and the vibes turned spectacularly on point so like. make of that what you will
===
@Vorvayne @philologicalbat @txj666 @GenderGriffins (.....he's all i can think about but that's fine since he's the only thing that matters anyway)
===
@madeIeina cutting chocolate milk in half
===
@geekygaymerguy Yay!! :D https://t.co/SUaIvFRLSs
===
@philologicalbat @whenasinsilks @txj666 @GenderGriffins I'm literally incapable of shutting up about this show and I'm pretty much not even sorry? So uh.

Phew okay deep breaths Vorvayne
===
@philologicalbat @whenasinsilks @txj666 @GenderGriffins The thing is that I too am usually way way behind everyone, fandom wise, and then I saw some gifs and was just like "okay so there's just no point in depriving myself of this is there" and for once I've had ZERO problems continuing to watch a show. That never happens.
===
@whenasinsilks @philologicalbat @txj666 Someone (it was @GenderGriffins) once said that Wex Kexing is like bastard son of Xue Yang and Tang Fan and listen. I've never heard anything more correct in my LIFE.
===
@philologicalbat @whenasinsilks @txj666 @GenderGriffins He's my very beautiful evil mastermind flirty viscerally violent son and personally I was utterly ruined when 1) he realised he accidentally fell in love For Real 2) "what do you mean you prefer my real personality which is bitter and vengeful over this carefully crafted flirt"
===
@Vorvayne @whenasinsilks @txj666 @GenderGriffins TROUBLING
===
@Vorvayne @whenasinsilks @philologicalbat @GenderGriffins that's... pretty accurate
===
@madeIeina @nottswift13 sounds like my twin!
===
@madeIeina YEAH.
===
@madeIeina i’d love that
===
@geekygaymerguy ah yes, this happened to me very recently as well. 

Yes my dear commenter, 3 years ago I was much worse at video games than I am now. By all means, unsubscribe. You are clearly not my audience 🤦🏽‍♀️
===
@GenderGriffins @publicetienne I gotta say, having woh and boya brainrot simultaneously has sure make the past two weeks very interesting, if a little intense.
===
@geekygaymerguy I once fielded an angry consumer mad about an insert we didn’t make. 😨

People feel entitled to complain when it’s even easier to be nice!
===
@geekygaymerguy I’m going on my second date tonight!
===
@geekygaymerguy Yay! I am so glad you are getting the Pfizer vaccine.
===
@emmalovehaz @loualwaysyouhaz @ireneinterlude and my brain hurts

@geekygaymerguy It looks so beautiful!! Can’t wait to try it 😍
===
@markh110 Hahahaha I mean... I’m not gonna stop ya 😂😂
===
@geekygaymerguy "Hi! There's the door! Thanks!"
===
@JanArrah @JimZub Not to be confused with Screen Crush, who have excellent and knowledgeable writers like Matt Singer.
===
@geekygaymerguy I promise, you will barely notice it. Afterwards, probably, but initial poke was like...wait, that’s it?
===
@geekygaymerguy Is this your first or second date?
===
@geekygaymerguy thats so exciting! Happy for you.
===
@HiDusty @geekygaymerguy I hear that, too - blocking is totally reasonable, too. But as long as they are just being petty and not offending people, I'll deal. :) Part of me just appreciates knowing that older videos are still getting views.
===
@geekygaymerguy Negative comments on old videos actually amuse me, esp when they point out something that had already been mentioned in other comments. I'm generally like, "Thanks for watching! This video is old, so I encourage you to watch my newer stuff which is so much better!" 🤣
===
@geekygaymerguy "please don't watch any of my future videos.

Thanks anyway..."
===
@SoloPlaythrus @geekygaymerguy If they're the type of person to negatively comment on a 3 year old video, I'd just as soon have them skip the new stuff too. :) I mean.. really? Complaints about not calling the token the exact right thing?
===
@madeIeina James
If you need a friend
Come right over
Don't even knock
And I'll be home
The door is always open
And we both can say, "Who's laughing now?"

AHHHH

@madeIeina I FORGOT
===
@madeIeina it looks too good for how mediocre the song is 😭
===
@madeIeina @alisevermore he wont, hes too homophobic
===
@madeIeina share them
===
@madeIeina NO LITERALLY
===
@geekygaymerguy Got a comment today explaining a rule about removing cards on one of our reviews. During the video we said we didn’t remove them to review the decks as shipped.
===
@JanArrah Have one on the way, and I CAN'T wait!
===
@JanArrah Or movie stuff.
===
@mekorios You should play Tell Me Why! Best Don't Nod game by a country mile.

@HerbWiseman No more generalities, Herb. Please itemize one thing the Green Party has done ANYWHERE that could be defined even loosely as anti-labour. I'll wait. @MartinBrampton
===
@geekygaymerguy @Pandasaurusgame @connorjwake Great photography Theo!!
===
@LiamKav @JonfuciusOnline I do agree. It doesn't make his decisions any better, but seeing the personal ramifications definitely makes it easier to swallow. The reset button approach is one of the reasons Voyager isn't my top Trek show. BUT...I think Janeway does show a subtle hardening with each decision
===
@madeIeina next week i think?
===
@madeIeina alright 2 hours to memorise this thing https://t.co/OVaqsfYprj

@LiamKav @IvyMcCat @UnrankedBadger @robinince Labour had a majority
===
@IvyMcCat @LiamKav @UnrankedBadger @robinince They told us they were left wing, why would I not believe them?  Corbyn was a racist crank - he was rejected by the working classes, and good riddance to him too
===
@IvyMcCat @LiamKav @UnrankedBadger @robinince There is nothing wrong with blue Labour.  In fact most of the working class is blue Labour, hence they vote Tory in the absence of that option
===
@IvyMcCat @LiamKav @UnrankedBadger @robinince It is an inconvenient truth
===
@LiamKav @CarolineMack18 @UnrankedBadger @robinince Exactly. Since Blue Labour were in charge of course they'd go to war. That's why Blair will never be trusted by the majority of the centre and left ever again.
===
@CarolineMack18 @LiamKav @UnrankedBadger @robinince No, New Labour had a majority.

Honestly, if you think New Labour was left wing I think that's where you're getting confused. We don't have a left wing party in this country. We nearly did under Corbyn, who was a democratic socialist (centre left) verging on socialist (left).
===
@CarolineMack18 @LiamKav @UnrankedBadger @robinince Erm... right. I'm out. "racist" indeed. Have a good day. This discussion is clearly going nowhere when you post unfounded rubbish like that.
