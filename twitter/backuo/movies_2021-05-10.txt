@donna_occhineri Hell yes, Cuaron is a very good director. I also like Gravity from him. That's awesome that you also like horror and action. I highly agree with you, if a movie is well written, well directed, well acted I don't care what genre it is OR If I've seen that in other films...

@gnutieL The director of G Gundam also went on to direct Shin Mazinger Z, which is a good entry point into Mazinger that I need to finish.

Popular opinion: It would not have done as well as it did if someone else other than Xiao Zhan had played WWX &amp; MXY. He was the perfect actor for the role. No one could have done it better.

my favorite movie genre is ‚Äúthe monstrosity of girlhood‚Äù

The genre is best described as slice of life, taking place in the mid-1980s theatre world. I know that's not a real genre, but that's what it is. You don't *need* to be super familiar w/ theatre to enjoy it, but should at least have a passing interest in the performing arts, lol.

Atmospheric thriller with fine Performances, topnotch visuals &amp; bgm. But Predictable slowpaced narration drags. Overall, an Ordinary movie with Extraordinary execution. Watch, if u r fan of world class cinemas of such genre.

@thefilmbuff30 Oh I loved Children of Men and Cuar√≥n is a great director. I like horror too, and good action films. If the film is well-written, with good dialogue and well developed characters, the genre isn't that important. It's lazy, stereotypical, clich√©d movies that I can't stand.

The separate journeys of Evey and Finch provide the narrative drive of "V for Vendetta", as they are the most relatable characters in the movie, the most humanistic.  They give the movie an emotional depth, an intensity, that elevate it above the normal comic book genre film. 3/x

opinion: amazing‚ù£Ô∏è IU is an amazing actress &amp; this is probably my 2nd fav role of hers (her character in My Mister is my 1st). the other actors/actresses are also amazing. the plot is v interesting &amp; well-written. I think many people would like this as well regardless of genre. https://t.co/xbzQ5LnymU

Initiation, 2020 - ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ https://t.co/Q8uboAZViK #FilmTwitter

Initiation is a movie in a dialectical argument with, not only itself and its genre, if we can even pin one down exactly, but with the ways we make moral sense of a world that's constantly being remediated by tec‚Ä¶ https://t.co/hu8kxIRurQ

Joss Whedon fucked over the MCU and DCEU irreparably by deciding every superhero should use Buffy humor and THAT more than anything else was an essential element of the comic movie genre while abusing his power at every opportunity and we will never be free of it

ok but i do need more movies like this, and dr strangelove, that highlight the absurdity of current events/society

@bales1181 @JanuaryMovie @ithrah69 @VaderJaws @filmizon You do realize this Science Fiction movie in particular invented the cinematic look of outer space in the movies, and singularly invented the vision of most Sci-Fi films of it's genre forever onward. It might seem boring because it was the prototype of the new genre of Sci-Fi.
