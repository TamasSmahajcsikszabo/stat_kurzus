it’s your least favorite task.
As new cases increase, you
still fail to police public health,
and so citizens ask: is Mike just
incredibly stupid — or perhaps
a virology Cupid? 🤒📈🏥

insurrection, and Biden to ban.
His voice wavered and pitched
as his hands fairly twitched
serving as 45’s hatchet man.
Betting everything on a dark horse?
Josh will pay a steep price in due course.

You’re in luck! No need to look too far.
Mike will enter the race …
Parson soon to replace.
One advantage: he’s not passed the Bar.
An unusual gov’t drift:
every officer seeks to upshift. 🤔

Herr Schmitt seems more likely, of
course, but Mike may seem frumpy
if Greitens (more Trumpy)
became Donald’s favored racehorse.
Then again, Parson may pick a hog
for the upcoming primary slog. 🤷🏼‍♂️
