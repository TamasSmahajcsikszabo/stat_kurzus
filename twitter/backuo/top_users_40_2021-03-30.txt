@BiaKing93 @GailSimone @TomTaylorMade Well they are both wrong its night man https://t.co/Txq7NMmnF7
===
@lancecjohnson @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Oh dude you‚Äôre right! Marvel man is one of my favorite characters! https://t.co/BCbiUEcQKF
===
@lancecjohnson @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Nah dude that‚Äôs blue beetle. Can‚Äôt you tell?
===
@GailSimone I created a hero loosely based on him!
===
@GailSimone I live for these tweets.
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography I would support it if I didn't already know DC has no interest. A shame, that.
===
@BiaKing93 @GamesWithFife @GailSimone @TomTaylorMade As someone who has Nightcrawler in their top 3 favorite Marvel characters this conversation makes me so sad and angry.
===
@GailSimone I prefer Plastic Man.
===
@BiaKing93 @GailSimone @TomTaylorMade Yup. Mah frenz is trollz supreme.
===
@BiaKing93 @GailSimone @TomTaylorMade They really are.
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone Proff X is your fav? Are you stable?
===
@Tri_State26 @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone We're talking about DC characters here, pal. Not Fawcett Comics.
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Pretty sure that's The Creeper.
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Oh, look who's humble-bragging about being the writer of Nightwing now.

I don't care if it's an excellent read and brought back some warm memories of Chuck Dixon's old run, I SEE WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
===
When friends who want to get into comics ask which writers I recommend, I will sometimes tell them to try @GailSimone and @TomTaylorMade... but now I‚Äôve had to have this conversation at 7am. https://t.co/nTHg9CO6Rj
===
@EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Firestar for me.
===
@GailSimone Me tooooooo!!!
===
@suade99 @HonestWill @GailSimone Yes, but it was a large part of my alcohol purchases every Saturday night during my sophomore year of college after the Super Friends went off the air.
===
@DerfBackderf @GailSimone I do believe Gail is trolling. She does that from time to time and it's pretty glorious.
===
@Mike_77Martinez @GailSimone Been following. By "trolling"... As in "being the butt of...?" &lt;sigh...&gt; you guyz...
===
@The_Cthulhu_Kid @GailSimone Would offhand be willing to grant that Wolverine might not have been one of the originals, but I am ‚Äúseveral percent‚Äù more positive that Nightcrawler wasn‚Äôt.
===
@GailSimone Been reading them since I was in 7th grade (circa 1964 or thereabouts...) You?
===
@chesire2050 @GailSimone Who, ‚Äúme‚Äù? Depends what u mean by ‚Äúnew‚Äù. In any case, not ‚Äòangrily arguing‚Äô anything like I see so often. Just recall Nightcrawler as a character addition, and also originally from the ‚Äúevil side‚Äù...
===
@Mike_77Martinez @GailSimone In any case. Apologies to all if any offense was given for daring to disagree. At the end of the day, I love the same books. And much "extra" apologies for being incorrect with any corrections...
üòéüññ
===
@GailSimone Well...not quite one of the "Original" X-Men. They were Cyclops, Jean Grey, Ice Man, the Beast, Wolverine and of course Professor X. Of those, Professor X was my favorite. Next, by "favorite powers" was Jean Grey.

üòéüññ
===
@Mike_77Martinez @GailSimone No, but we're talking comics here, friend Mike. I'm 71 years old later this year. I was "there" paying the 12 cents for the comic went it came out. And reading it...
===
@GailSimone Read the entirety of the story as you recorded it...This one made me cry...INSTANTLY...üò¢
===
@TheDemonClown @GailSimone I'm replying to a much respected and talented, published author...Who happens to be incorrect regarding 1 thing that she has stated. Am I incorrect in that assessment?
===
@mlm_1981 @GailSimone Much respect to accomplished author Ms. Simone (me? not so much as far as being published goes...) HOWEVER... https://t.co/qI90MX3Oj9

@typedbyme @GailSimone @DCComics @comiXology @GilPhotography Thank you! And thanks for helping show @JimLee that there is a market for her!

@GailSimone Hopefully they see this! You‚Äôd knock this out of the park!
===
@M007md92 @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography Right?!!!!
===
@HellblazerArts @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography A Hawkwoman comic written by Gail Simone  would do soooo well! Add @david_baldeon and it would probably rival any current DC/Marvel title out right now!

@StanKubica @GailSimone @DCComics @comiXology @GilPhotography Thanks üòä
===
@GailSimone Definitely was better than the theatrical release
===
@GailSimone You are a true master.  Are you taking on apprentices? FYI, I'm a Shark.
===
@GailSimone G.I. Joe was always my favorite X-Man https://t.co/JshRWpzLGC
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone Gail is right, original X-Men team was Night Crawler, Kitty Pride, Rogue and Deadpool.
===
@Da_Baron_ @GailSimone That's back when Hawkeye was the leader of West Coast Morlocks.
===
@khneori @GailSimone Cyclops can cook them with his heat vision.
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone You do realize that Gail and basically everyone else here is trolling you, stick around Gail does this kind of stuff all the time, she's a fun follow.
===
@JollyBaba @widely_ranged @GailSimone Ah yes, I remember those great battles with Mutant kind's greatest foe, Batroc the Leaper.
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone I'm sure you've been to college Herb, can you use Wikipedia as a citable source when writing a term paper?
===
@GailSimone I quit reading after that Professor X guy joined the series, the original X-Men were better when they were led by M.O.D.O.K.
===
@GailSimone I think he's Speed Racer's older brother https://t.co/Tr6Q299QpZ
===
@UrsusArctosHor1 @JollyBaba @widely_ranged @GailSimone The Amazing friends were Fire Star, Ice Man, and Aunt May, Peter Parker was that 4th roommate that was always late with his part of the rent.
===
@GailSimone Mine is Beast Boy.
===
Nightcrawler and Beast! https://t.co/B0BChbNxEe
===
@alanou @GailSimone In the CW tv show "DC's Legends of Tomorrow" they had a version of Isis that they never called "Isis" but only used her given name of  Zari Tomaz. Isis is due to appear in the Black Adam movie starring The Rock.
Maybe she'll get an new better version in DC's Infinite Frontier ...
===
@alanou @GailSimone Since about 2006 the DC version of Isis has been linked to Black Adam, worked into his history. Sometimes she has also been an anti-hero and insane villainess through 4 reboots during Dan Didio's tenure. Her name was also problematic because of the prominence of ISIS/ISIL
===
@GailSimone I love that artist who did that Shazam picture; he has an entire fan series of his own version of a DC parallel world.
===
@RRPatLaw @GailSimone He's in that issue too. The cover is during the day though and he only crawls at night
===
@TheDougKayne @EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone That makes sense as Dave Cockrum worked on both books.
===
@TheDougKayne @EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Well if Nightcrawler was an original team member then I‚Äôd imagine Cockrum created the X-Men! /s and prolly the Legion too!!!!! /s
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Nightwing... or Darkwing Duck?
===
@GailSimone Mine too
===
@JoshuaYehl @GailSimone @GameSpot A critic called out the apparently poor human characters in GvK (I haven't seen it yet) and a bunch of people who have seeminglg not critically watched the Toho Godzilla movies are misremembering the way the best of those movies work.
===
@GailSimone I'm a large fan of Morph
===
@EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Nightcrawler was the only original member of the X-Men that was also a founding member of the Legion of Super Heroes.  His moving from DC to Marvel paved the way for all subsequent crossovers.
===
@ericsferguson @EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Who‚Äôs Dave Cockrum?  üòù
===
@GailSimone No, but I understand the confusion. They are both narcs.
===
@SavaniaGames Depends on the game. When it comes to campaign games i want to win every time. They being said i can deal with a loss. I would say that with coops in general i want it to be hard but once i am good at it win more than I loose
===
@SavaniaGames I need to be having fun the moment that‚Äôs not the case is the moment I disengage with the game and sell it.
===
@GailSimone I can't with these people  üò≠, I just.... I can't

@SkinlessGestate @GailSimone None that matter.

Much condensing of components, some features and rules are happening behind the scenes to squish this concept into a tuck box, and hopefully a much lower price point üôÄ
===
@MinervaTabletop An impossibly hard task sometimes. Especially when you think you're finally done and you perform the unspeakable crime of looking at it again the following day. Suddenly, 12 pages feels like 50 and you woefully start crimping copy again!

@AtikinGames @EightAteEight @ddaviddx2 Can you remember way-back when (I might be showing my age here), there used to be a series of Micro-Machines with little windows in the roof. You could peer inside and see very detailed artwork of the inside of a car in there. I think we need a game using this 'mechanic'! üòÖüöó

@hankstv @SkinlessGestate @GailSimone You mean "Nightcrawler And His Blue &amp; Gold Bitches"

@GailSimone I love that "BOOMTH" sound he makes when he disappears

@widely_ranged @GailSimone Incorrect about everything but her credentials, yes

@GailSimone How can you pass over Forge like that

@GailSimone Guess it depends on what you call the ‚ÄúOriginal X-Men.‚Äù
BTW I bought this issue when it came out. https://t.co/TCpQQHfsBY
===
@GailSimone fuck yeah ü§òü§òü§ò hmm. i dont think nightcrawler could use this emoji. :/
===
@GailSimone A just and utterly fair conclusion!
===
@jimmytcannon @41Rco @GailSimone I love it! I learned something and got to make a silly joke.
===
You guys, this is happening in real time. *pops corn* https://t.co/VQy6lnSw5a
===
@41Rco @GailSimone I thought The Bear was on the Russian equivalent, Das X-Comrades.
===
@GailSimone Colossus is always underrated.

@GailSimone Of the original, I have to go with Marrow.

@GailSimone You have to solvent for x so it has to be paste pot Pete üò∏

@GailSimone You are a god tier troll! Love it

@widely_ranged @GailSimone Nice double troll!
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Wait, this guy? https://t.co/NKwUAjtcWA
===
@GailSimone Wow. The "but... actually" folks just can't resist Gail bait. Besides, everyone knows Thunderbird was the best original member of the X-Men.
===
@GailSimone Oh Nightclops. Classic.
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography Hawkgirl wearing that sporty outfit in JLU was so good, the whole League should have had some form of casual athletic wear!
===
@GailSimone Dang lady, how do you have the time ?
===
@GailSimone So were Deacon Blues songs üéµ
===
@GailSimone I remember 2003, first time I saw him in live-action. I WENT NUTS!
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Nightwing wasn‚Äôt one of the original X-Men, Tom. 
You‚Äôre thinking of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.
===
@GailSimone If Nightcrawler isn't the original X-Man what does the X stand for?
===
@GailSimone I'm not a big X-Men reader, but it's hard to top original members like Wolverine and Storm.
===
@GailSimone So do 20 million other people worldwide, if only the WM exec had the brain. #restorethesynderverse
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone It‚Äôs very clear she was thinking about Knight Rider. https://t.co/lF3eH7dshW
===
Well, at least we know what X-Men fans will be going crazy about today... https://t.co/YM0TpHK0bc
===
@GailSimone Same.
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone What u smoking Tom. Clearly u both r mistaking Nightcrawler and Nightwing for Night thrasher, the original X-Man üôÑ
===
@MatchesMalone @beckycloonan @GailSimone No Marvel or DC, it's the Jaws Universe.
===
@beckycloonan @mooncalfe1 So, to review, this would be what remains of Quint as he apparently survived being swallowed whole?

Bionics are a thing.

So, is this the DC or Marvel Universe?

#MikeShieldsII @GailSimone should write this.... #in
===
@GailSimone My favorite X-Man as well. :)
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography @david_baldeon I would love a Hawkwoman series I can see that that is awesome writing/artist team and it would rivial any title the 2 would put out we really need it and it would fit so in infinite frontier line https://t.co/aBMZGi1Jki

@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography Gracie you need your own comic I mean Hawkwoman does üòÖüòç cause I would love to read a ass kicking redhead ü•µ https://t.co/1rzqw3Aj8e
===
@GailSimone Also, the one on the left is the presumably ‚ÄúCanny‚Äù X-Men. The originals were very uncanny.
===
@GailSimone Who is Gambit? Is that they guy who can shrink down because of exposure to Gamma radiation?
===
@GailSimone Almost, a later story revealed he was in the same circus as The Blob in issue number 3

@GailSimone When I started reading xmen as a teen, I started with Giant Sized XMen and went from there. So, to me, he also is my favorite original X-Man.
===
@RRPatLaw @GailSimone They must've discounted it for leaving out Nightcrawler.
===
@41Rco @GailSimone Is this X-mansplaining? How many people have already asked this?
===
@GailSimone Have we ever seen a lady godzilla?
===
@GailSimone 6) Comics and spam.
===
@GailSimone I was always partial to Zan and Jayna.
===
@GailSimone If by ‚Äúlove‚Äù you mean ‚Äúfind terribly long and a waste of my time to watch‚Äù, then I agree #ZackSnydersJusticeLeague needed a better editor
===
@GailSimone My favorite ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù X-Men team member is definitely Nightcrawler but Gambit is a close second
===
@GailSimone They both da same because it's white and has Cyclops!

@GailSimone Ackshuallyyyy...

@GailSimone A bear watching cartoons? https://t.co/oxdQ82GiSN

@GailSimone Ah, that explains it

@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Bloodfued #78 commencing in 5....4....3....
===
@GailSimone Same, and second was Beast, then Raven.
===
@GailSimone Mine too.
===
@OfSelina @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone No, you're thinking of THIS Night Man. https://t.co/RzalZI5KnS
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone Technically, Gambit's sister was good at chess in the 50s, later appearing in the New Mutants film. Do your research.
===
@GailSimone I didn't watch many of the GoBots films, so I don't have an opinion
===
@drawin_casscain @GailSimone Here's to realizing that your initial perception of this movie was influenced by factors not related to your own actual opinion
===
@lancecjohnson @GailSimone Nightwing? 
I wrote NightCRAWLER. See. https://t.co/E5tPPbYMgi
===
@GailSimone Nightcrawler wasn‚Äôt one of the original X-Men, Gail. 
You‚Äôre thinking of Nightwing.

@GailSimone Great character love the X-Men

@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone No no no. Nightingale

===
@fleetwoodmarco @jamesroyal @jasonenright @NerdyJunk @mistertoybox @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Moon Knight was... um... briefly a West Coast Avenger? Man, that dude was not a joiner.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure you meant Misty Knight.
===
@GailSimone Still can't get over how the character was based on Jake Gyllenhaal, pure genius https://t.co/c9SA4kNnM8
===
@GailSimone I love to imagine you typing these out on your phone, hitting tweet, and just cackling as you walk away.
===
@jamesroyal @jasonenright @NerdyJunk @mistertoybox @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Nah, Nightside was a member of the Imperial Guard. She‚Äôs referring to Moon Knight.
===
@designerscott @RRPatLaw @RMOURz @GailSimone Eyeclops is underrated, Gail said so.
===
@GailSimone I get the joke, but I'm lost not knowing if you do love Nightcrawler or if you're dissing him right now.

WHAT IS REAL

üòò
===
@GailSimone It's his professional name when he teaches night school.
That's why he looks like Bull from Night Court.
He gets his powers at night.
===
@Minxysshoes She‚Äôs so nice she would hand you a tissue! I promise!!! Make sure you meet her @GailSimone
===
@chmpgneprbIm LITERALLY WHAT IS THE PROBLEM WJAT IS THE PROBLEM
===
@mistertoybox @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Night Thrasher was on New Warriors. You‚Äôre thinking of Nightmare.
===
@jamesroyal @jasonenright @NerdyJunk @mistertoybox @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone @aceCourtBot render
===
@GailSimone Me too! It's basically a love letter to the characters and world. You can just feel the passion radiating from every beautiful, detailed frame. It's mind blowing that it exists and that we get to watch it.
===
@GailSimone Mine is Dr Strange, love the way he swings around New York
===
@GailSimone Love you Gail but why you such a troll
===
@ThisTimUren @GailSimone Ah. Carry on.
===
@ThisTimUren @GailSimone You mean Beast, don‚Äôt you?
===
@Graciecosplay @GailSimone @DCComics @comiXology @GilPhotography These are the best cosplay wings I think I have seen anywhere!!! Well done!!!
===
@GailSimone Yep. 
And X-Man was their leader and founder.
===
@GailSimone He's my second favorite original X-Men but he's my favorite Outsider. https://t.co/NnYilbnavG
===
@GailSimone Bomf!
===
@GailSimone Nightcrawler and Colossus are my favorites
===
@jasonenright @NerdyJunk @mistertoybox @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Nighthawk was a Defender. I‚Äôm pretty sure she meant Nightside.
===
@GailSimone Of all the original Nightcrawlers, Nightcrawler is my favorite.
===
@GailSimone If this gets Nightcrawler trending I‚Äôm here for it. #nightcrawler
===
@NerdyJunk @mistertoybox @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Night Girl was from the Legion of Superheroes, she must mean NightHawk.
===
@GailSimone Respectfully, and as much as I love Kurt, no, he wasn't. The original 1963 X-Men were Cyclops, Marvel Girl/Jean Grey, Beast, Iceman &amp; Angel. The new team introduced in 1975 in Giant Size #1 were Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, Thunderbird, Colossus, &amp; Nightcrawler üòâ https://t.co/K9yhtLrVZs

@AlvaroIM77 @RMOURz @GailSimone Cheers and for the record I'm a fan of Gail/familiar with her famous Punisher tweets lol. I honestly meant no disrespect, it's just X-Men is sacred to me like Star Wars IV-VI, in that they (and Joh Byrne's artwork) are what gave me my lifelong love of comics in the early '80süòâ

@RMOURz @GailSimone Somehow I feel I'm missing a joke here lol

@SavaniaGames Winning is always fun, losing can not sting so much either. Like the others, we're a mixed bag. If we play a game that we're always getting annihilated (or we go in already feeling hopeless) the game forfeits all meaning / fun because we feel the "why bother?"
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone what could tom taylor possibly know about nightwing pfft
===
@GailSimone How can you not put Deadpool as #1?
===
@Matthew_S_Brown @GailSimone I'm pretty sure you're wrong, he was in X-Factor too.
===
@Matthew_S_Brown @GailSimone You don't even have X-23 on that list. Don't you read the comics?
===
@GailSimone He's the bald guy in a wheel chair who throws electric playing cards.

@GailSimone Knightmare sequence, untapped potential?

@GailSimone Wally West.
===
@GailSimone His banter with Quislet was quite the bee‚Äôs knees.
===
@mistertoybox @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone He was a New Warrior, she totally means Night Girl.
===
@EvaIsAdorable @chesire2050 @JimSeals1701 @GailSimone I'm partial to the live action version myself https://t.co/rpuDEcu6bl
===
@RRPatLaw @RMOURz @GailSimone And I honestly was commending you for catching on and aknowledging it. I wish the other dude had done something similar!

And just to make you smile: https://t.co/Ty6MW8p4yw
===
@RRPatLaw @RMOURz @GailSimone Yes. Gail often does these troll posts about clearly... not accurate... stuff.

But don't feel bad. You quickly caught on. Last week we had someone who, well...

@chesire2050 @JimSeals1701 @EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone I mean, just LOOK at that design! So powerful! https://t.co/bEaF95OYGc
===
@GailSimone Was he the worm guy
===
@GailSimone What Rogue calls Gambit on their off time is HER business
===
@GailSimone Mine's definitely Grogu, the way he led them against Pikachu the leader of the brotherhood of evil transformers was such a great story.
===
@SunshineCVE @TomTaylorMade @GailSimone With thunderous likes retweets and replies
===
@GailSimone he like Wolverine were on the ‚Äònew‚Äô team when the OG‚Äôs Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Iceman, Angel went missing on Kraroka.  after being rescued, Cyclops remained to train new team.  the other OG quit. Giant X-Men #1 kicked off the new team as status quo
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Nightwing wasn‚Äôt one of the original X-Men, you‚Äôre thinking of Nighthawk
===
@GailSimone I still can't get over what a completely different film it is &amp; that I love it more with each watch
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone No you‚Äôre thinking of Night Man https://t.co/XPoVKqn7XQ
===
@GailSimone Potentially unpopular opinion: it should be Nightcrawler, not Cyclops, who eventually ascends to become the elder mentor character and take Xavier‚Äôs place in that role.
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone You‚Äôre both wrong. Night Shade was one of the original Xmen
===
@Wes__Arnold @GailSimone Breakfast is most important meal of day.
===
@GailSimone Deadpool is my favorite original X-man!
===
@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone Nah, Nightwing was on Teen Titans. You‚Äôre thinking of Night Thrasher.
===
@RRPatLaw @GailSimone Wait... so you‚Äôre telling me THIS is the original? If that‚Äôs so, where‚Äôs Nightcrawler? FAKE! üòâ
===
@RRPatLaw @GailSimone Ah right, so this is one of those cheap fakes they made in the 80s
===
@designerscott @GailSimone I'm pretty sure that's The Hulk
===
@sht33v @designerscott @GailSimone Ohh, so this guy must be The Hulk https://t.co/VF8hU3BK6h

@TomTaylorMade @GailSimone So this is how the Internet breaks.....

@GailSimone Gail, thank you for distracting me from my headache. You are the Queen of Twitter. Nay Queen of Social Media.
===
@Graciecosplay @GailSimone @DCComics @comiXology @GilPhotography OMG you ARE Hawkgirl! That‚Äôs amazing!!!
===
@GailSimone There were things that were much better, and there were things that didn‚Äôt really land for me. And I get why, but some of Whedon‚Äôs scenes could have been left in. But I ain‚Äôt telling no one how to live their lives.
===
@GailSimone JUMP!!! JUMP!!!
===
@itgetsreallybad @Thrabalen @widely_ranged @GailSimone Angel would eat Nightcrawler because he‚Äôs a vampire with a Sole.
Get it? Because night crawlers are worms, see, and fish eat... they eat w... ahem. That‚Äôs the joke.
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography Awesome
===
@GailSimone You trolling?
===
@GailSimone Of the original members of Alpha Flight, Wolverine is not the shortest.
===
@widely_ranged @The_Cthulhu_Kid @GailSimone You ‚Äúmight‚Äù huh?  You should just go ahead and full onhand accept it.  Logan was up in Alberta eating poutine while baldy was getting inappropriately fresh with his red headed charge.
===
@GailSimone The best original xman is xman
===
@GailSimone Kurt, Logan, Banshee, and Storm were the entire X-Men for me.
===
@GailSimone Can we agree X2 still holds up as an excellent movie - and not just the opening with Nightcrawler?
===
@GailSimone I like how Storm is literally exploding buckets of energy all over the place and yet says "I come in peace!"
===
@GailSimone Who is Wolverine? The flying woman?
===
@GailSimone Wolver-who? 
I don't think he was one of the original fab five.
And it ISN'T Cyclops. It's Slim "I must keep my power in check" Summers.
===
@GailSimone I know this is a wind up, but also YES https://t.co/XV9fFoW2vv
===
@faerytaleonfire @designerscott @GailSimone that cant be teh hulk because hes green

@GailSimone I know what's happening...and yet this still has me twitching.  Machiavellian bear puppeteers are kind of terrifying.

@GailSimone Imagine mansplaining X-Men to Gail Simone...
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone 3: The more you push back the more you look bad.  It's kind of her attempt to teach people about that "Um Actually" reflex they have.  
4: we're all a little mad here...
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone Alright Friendo, clearly you're new in the Gail-Simone Corner of the Twitter-sphere.  That's okay.

1: Gail Simone is a very accomplished, and fairly well known modern comic writer.  
2: Gail is going to say a number of things you will certainly remember are "wrong",Gail's Right
===
@GailSimone I don't know how serious she is, but I will argue that she's right.  There is dignity in bringing joy.  There is dignity in forcing people to confront their own need to be right.  There is dignity in being caring.  All of these things are what her posts are about.
===
@GailSimone Of all the original X-men, I feel like Darkhawk is the one that really stands out
===
@chesire2050 @AlvaroIM77 @JimSeals1701 @GailSimone And the redux costume for all new x-men in the 1980's... stunning https://t.co/5v04TaTiBs

@chesire2050 @AlvaroIM77 @JimSeals1701 @GailSimone Right? Wasn't that the one with fred astaire as Doctor Doom (super intimidating)? You can't go wrong with the classics https://t.co/5K3SA19V7j
===
@chesire2050 @AlvaroIM77 @JimSeals1701 @GailSimone epic stuff
===
@robtarange @GailSimone Oh, totally, and the fights she would have with the Craig Lawson Raven were fantastic
===
@chesire2050 @AlvaroIM77 @JimSeals1701 @GailSimone I'm sorry, but this one is still my favorite Xavier costume https://t.co/6ox4HmM4VO
===
@GailSimone I support this retcon
===
@GailSimone Nightcrawler is a Second Generation X-man. But he‚Äôs a favorite of mine, for that second wave.
===
@chesire2050 @AlvaroIM77 @EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone I remember his co-star: https://t.co/UwKkEiR1Kq
===
@chesire2050 @EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Why must y‚Äôall make my heart hurt?
===
@GeekyGeekyWays @Graciecosplay @GailSimone Yes. Perez, Rucka and Heinman‚Äôs WW are better. Innumerable Batman runs. Watchmen. Keith Giffen‚Äôs Justice League runs.
===
@GeekyGeekyWays @Graciecosplay @GailSimone It‚Äôs a blessing in disguise for Red Simoneja. Diana would get sick of her one-note bitching within 3 pages and would suplex her into the sun
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone You're new here, aren't you?
===
@JimSeals1701 @EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone I know, I'm sad Darkhawk never joined the avengers either.. But his time in x-force was great
===
@EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Darkhawk is HIGHLY underappreciated..
===
@EvaIsAdorable @AlvaroIM77 @JimSeals1701 @GailSimone And that's just Xaviers..

@bbofun @widely_ranged @GailSimone And their mortal enemy, Groo the conqueror

@AlvaroIM77 @EvaIsAdorable @JimSeals1701 @GailSimone remember the noir version? https://t.co/R34kclX6uH

@GailSimone Love Nightcrawler. So '90s! https://t.co/EdhDYx7BJL

@GailSimone I could SMELL them before I even clicked. Also Colossus is better than any 1st generation xman. Fight me. https://t.co/oHon4Z9UCN

This is sad but beautiful.  
Here‚Äôs to you Z-Hawk. https://t.co/Q0h5U8zhiU
===
@fencingmonkey @GailSimone You also forgot Posh X and Scary X. But props on including the oft-overlooked Sporty X üëä
===
@GailSimone So much foolishness, follow her advice:
READ
THE 
COMICS https://t.co/TK4KLf4McJ
===
@GailSimone Also, they need to promote Wolverine more. He's not seen very often.
===
@GailSimone Good choice. https://t.co/q0s2Xb31yb
===
@GailSimone Does Magneto count since he was in that first issue and has been a member of the team now? https://t.co/BJCqDqIJ7e
===
@GailSimone No no no Nightcrawler is a fishing lure https://t.co/wfjLo56G1h
===
@GailSimone I only got the first two, I need to get this one. Will there be more coming?
===
@GailSimone He should have replaced Cyclops I know, we all try to block out painful moments. Nightcrawler has always been one of my favorites though. I often ask myself how fuzzy is he exactly?~
===
@GailSimone Right...I'm an amateur when it comes to X-Men. 
I dont know the X-Men members.
Youve got Logan, Cyclops, Storm, Rogue, Jean Grey, Beast, Iceman, Charles Xavier, who are the others?
Who are the villains?
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography yes yes yesüî•üî•
===
@GailSimone Classic Gail trolling. We all know that Nightcrawler was not an original X-Man. 

He was an original Avenger!
===
@GailSimone How many times have you watched it? ü•∫ I'm going for 13 today!
===
@GailSimone Nightcrawler's adamantium heat vision is pretty cool.
===
@GailSimone Well AcTuAlLy...  :)   Nightcrawler was my favorite from the 90s cartoon.  And games, when he was in them.
===
@GailSimone Disclaimer: No mentions of taints. https://t.co/Vrxp3nO58S
===
@GailSimone I disagree, we need something All-New, perhaps even All-Different.
===
@GailSimone so hard to pick a fave from the original lineup but mine's definitely Firestar https://t.co/c6IjHn2ksD
===
@GailSimone Bamf!
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography Beautiful
===
Gail is doing my favorite thing, correcting people on Twitter about comics https://t.co/w6FXxcLJea
===
@MuppetArmy76 @GailSimone He-Man, Spider-Man, Bat-Man, Action-Man, Ant-Man. The "X" in X-Men is a variable representing all the different types of Man in the team!
===
@mythcreants @GailSimone Yes, but King Shark is (famously) a shark, and a shark is a kind of fish, and what do you do if you love fish and want to get lots of them?

You troll.
===
@VicRosFer @GailSimone No, he originated in the first run of Uncanny in 1942 by Bill Finger.
===
@e_oni_onigiri @annamaria_jp @widely_ranged @GailSimone Oh, man, I've never been here for one while it's happening! https://t.co/IrFJdODT6t
===
@mythcreants @GailSimone How to tell if Gail is trolling:

1) Did Gail tweet something?
===
@GailSimone I love the people that argue with...checks bio and history...someone that does this for a living. Twittersplaining should be punished by account removal.
===
@The_Unflattered @GailSimone Indeed. It‚Äôs just fun to provide additional mass to the endeavor.
===
@GailSimone The bald guy
===
@GailSimone Cyclops for me. 
Yeah, still not recovering from him being trending last week.
Loooove him. https://t.co/yGrycLmDP4
===
@GailSimone Your writing for Domino and Hotshots was FANTASTIC! I loved all the characters.
===
@GailSimone Jean Luc Picard was my favorite
gandalf at Hogwarts.

Nightcrawler is the best but I think they flattened the character when they made religion his major, almost only, defining characteristic.
===
@chmpgneprbIm l for laur is straight &lt;333
===
@chmpgneprbIm that‚Äôs what he calls me
===
@GailSimone You have excellent taste‚úîüíô https://t.co/A6scOn6BfT
===
@GailSimone Why do you spread lies like this, Gail?  You know you've never liked Nightcrawler.
===
@GailSimone The Beast, then Wolverine, then Nightcrawler...
===
@chmpgneprbIm that‚Äôs his tramp stamp
===
@chmpgneprbIm yeah me
===
@chmpgneprbIm EXACTLY
===
@GailSimone Me too
===
@ThisTimUren @GailSimone You can clearly see in the cover on the left that Cyclops had gotten his heat vision by that time too.
===
@GailSimone She's the absolute best #BlackWidow #WidowWarriors
===
@GailSimone Robin forever.
===
@GailSimone Let‚Äôs retcon him in earlier just like Sage. I‚Äôm sure Chuck could have loud of reasonable reasons to train him as a spy... in the circus.
===
@tyschalter @bomani_jones @GailSimone The latter for sure, the former is depressing but I'll never get tired of nerds self-owning themselves trying to dorksplain to the people who outclass them without them having the brains to check first
===
All of the people correcting Gail Simone in the replies are confused, she's obviously talking about the original Nightcrawler from Timely Comics who looked like a human but was actually an android powered by 20,000 sentient worms. https://t.co/b0jXjssIi7
===
@GailSimone Of all the original Excalibur members, Nightcrawler was my second favorite.
===
This book is still one of my reigning favorite series ever. https://t.co/w7jWJnTysx
===
@GailSimone It‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt understand how numbers work, Momma Gail!
===
@GailSimone Stands to reason, Gail. https://t.co/yynng41KIL
===
@widely_ranged @chesire2050 @GailSimone The movies are not the comics. 

As actual comics readers know, the original X-Men were Nightcrawler, Matter-Eater Lad, Herbie the Fat Wonder, and, of course, https://t.co/hOpRUbD5Jx
===
@GailSimone I don't know. The ability to turn into a bunch of worms and attract fish always seemed like a pretty useless power.
Well, except when they went up against Carpman and the Pink Salmon.
===
@GailSimone It's uncanny how many people still take Gail's bait.  Just astonishing.
===
@GailSimone @david_baldeon 's panel of flattered, embarrassed Neena on that page is just so evocative. These books are a perfect storm of right author, right artist, right characters
===
@GailSimone And there goes the internet, thank you again Miss Gail. üòÅ https://t.co/QUM72MDfjw
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography We miss Shayera, @JimLee, @mariejavins, @Ben_Abernathy, @ConroyForReal, @MichaelCotton, @whatthe_shea, @Williamson_Josh. A Hawkwoman mini-series is long overdue! She never had one. Please take a chance with Shay. https://t.co/XdrvRDMqBf
===
@rickloganhaha @GailSimone It's a game. And it's SUPER fun.
===
@GailSimone The one on left shows Nightcrawler before he turned all blue and fuzzy. He was grey for a little bit there too.
===
@GailSimone Professor X is Alvin Nathaniel Joiner's name when he teaches. https://t.co/37cd6fgciT
===
@lithrian1 @GailSimone @GameSpot The only human interaction I want to see in a Godzilla vs Kong movie is the human getting squashed, eaten, or tossed by said Godzilla and/or Kong.
===
@GailSimone @GameSpot I can't wait for their Mortal Kombat review: "I wish there was a little more romance in this MMA tournament to the death over earth's fate."
===
@GailSimone He got recruited by Batman, IIRC
===
@GailSimone My favorite for decades but I thought they killed him off. Not that death means anything in comics
===
What's funnier to watch happen over and over again: white guys trying to prove to @bomani_jones that racism isn't real, or nerds trying to correct @GailSimone on geek trivia she intentionally gets wrong as a bit?
===
dang it, now i have the urge to re-read these. https://t.co/7zQiNwmfsw
===
@GailSimone No, Gambit's the one with the magnetic powers. He always had a "gambit" for defeating the X-Men.
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone Wolverine wasn't one of the original. Angel, however, was. And Professor X was never a team member... he mentored the team.
===
@CarlosFreytesJr @ZombieHunted @ThreeKobolds @widely_ranged @GailSimone It's funny how in his haste to correct one of Gail's "mistakes", he made two of his own. It's like a Hail Hydra of incorrect, cut down one error and two shall rise in its place.
===
@bluepoet3 @ThreeKobolds @widely_ranged @GailSimone Yes, but he changed his name to just Beast when he joined the main X-Men team.
===
@bluepoet3 @ThreeKobolds @widely_ranged @GailSimone Nah, Changeling is Rogue's shapeshifting adopted mother. And Nightcrawler's actual mother. Hey, we brought this full circle!
===
@ThreeKobolds @widely_ranged @GailSimone Not new enough to say a word about Nightcrawler. :P
===
@steve_stclair @GailSimone Which is weird cause usually sharks and bears are natural enemies.
===
@GailSimone Dunno enough about the X-Men to tell if this is a troll but we do love Nightcrawler.
===
@steve_stclair @GailSimone She seems to be sincere in her love of King Shark though.
===
@GailSimone Dummy, Professor X is the guy who gets murdered in Clue.
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography You looking kinda cute tho ngl.......
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography Hawkgirl was soo flawless and charismatic in JLA animated series. https://t.co/DAcLNSOV8N
===
@chmpgneprbIm literally why would you even be in a relationship at this pointüò≠ they clearly don‚Äôt trust eachother
===
@GailSimone "Hey, it goes 1, 2, 3... 7!!!!!"

"Don't you mean 4?"

"BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!! I KNEW THAT ALL ALONG!!! YOU FOOL!!!"
===
@GailSimone Anyway, Secret Six is still one of my favorite books.
===
@GailSimone Easier fix: I won't bug ya. Tons of other tweets on this site I can look at if one bothers me. Sorry to bother you.
===
@GailSimone Eh, it‚Äôs been a day. I know there‚Äôs no harm in trolling people like this really. It‚Äôs just, I‚Äôve seen this joke, y‚Äôknow? Seen it a lot and some days I find it mean-spirited.
===
@Thrabalen @ThreeKobolds @widely_ranged @GailSimone Pretty sure it was "changed" to Changeling.
===
@ThreeKobolds @Thrabalen @widely_ranged @GailSimone Beast Boy came before Wolverine, I believe.
===
@johnrsmithjnr @GailSimone Yet hilarious.  Every time she brings up a topic, it trends all over twitter...and people still have no clue.  It is a joy to behold.
===
@GailSimone I love me some Kurt Wagner! https://t.co/Nf94u0EBxo
===
if @gailsimone said the original x-men were Spawn, Batman, Popeye, and a joke-cracking coconut I‚Äôd assume I had either:

just learned something and needed to update my understanding of the marvel universe

Or

Missed the joke.

I *would not* correct her via Twitter. #freeadvice https://t.co/PikXbia8bN

@GailSimone Every true fan knows he's the tenth iteration of the secret government Professor Project.

So why HASN'T @GailSimone been given Rowan and Will to write yet WOTC?!? https://t.co/tLRqneBCCx

@K3n_5s @Thrabalen @GailSimone No, you're thinking about Metallo. Rhino is the one who smashed people to bits.

@GailSimone Everyday you wake up and choose violence üòÇüòÇüòÇ
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography Definitely, Hawkgirl deserves her comic run.

@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography DC needs to stop sleeping on Hawkwoman! She's a force of nature! Please Give her a book @JimLee. @mariejavins. @Ben_Abernathy. @Williamson_Josh. @ConroyForReal. @MichaelCotton. @whatthe_shea. @michelewells. @thedcnation. @DCComics.

I'm not even made about this, Kurt's my favourite Marvel character. :) https://t.co/rtZUvlKl8o
===
@GailSimone Did you enjoy writing White Fox too?
===
@Manruss @GailSimone Would it have really killed them to CGI in the tail.
===
@GailSimone My favorite original X-man was Dick York.
===
@GailSimone This was the real original X-Men team https://t.co/UloT1CZsoJ

@GailSimone So that's why I heard a million nerds screaming
===
Who is Professor X is that Gambit https://t.co/4sG38Fsy2Q
===
@PaulJAndrew @GameSpot It's all the review stuff lately. Just insufferable.
===
There are just FIVE HOURS left on this remarkable book, a comic filled with crossword puzzles. I have had an advance look and I LOVED it. Take a look and get in on it!

@LuigiDNapla I always let them in on the joke if they take it seriously.

Also, easy fix, just block me!
===
Of all the original X-Men, Nightcrawler is my favorite.
===
DAMN! https://t.co/AE1PRTASxy
===
Nightcrawler was one of the original X-Men. Sorry. Read the comics. https://t.co/tq6RACTVvl

Yep, still love the #snydercut.

Here is a secret.  I loved writing Black Widow in DOMINO: HOTSHOTS.

She's so cool and classy. https://t.co/jTMfkMO1Ah

Excuse me but look at the price of that book on the left, vs the one on the right.

It had to come MUCH LATER, making the one on the right the original. https://t.co/1PUEcSszFD

The good one, Christy! https://t.co/RcxFobYmba

@LuigiDNapla You seem tense.

@slurketta YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE
===
I just watch cartoons https://t.co/me1obx6PTh
===
@Thrabalen @L1ttleR3d @GailSimone No, you're thinking of Magneto. Gambit is the big shiny Russian guy. People who mess with him get smashed to bits. üòÖ
===
@GailSimone Give us the tea on making tea
===
@GailSimone The Domino blush is when I fell in love...with @david_baldeon  art.
===
@GailSimone Yay! I don't know what qualifies as "original" (for me, I grew up loving the 90s cartoon so much! So that was "my" original, before discovering the comics) but I absolutely adored both Nightcrawler &amp; Beast (&amp; an on-again-off-again thing with Gambit)! https://t.co/gy6qzPcaBU
===
@duckhelmet @GailSimone yep he was
===
@GailSimone I loooooved this convo. üòç
===
@GailSimone I think if I ask an artist to do a Hawkgirl commission for me, I'm just going to send them those pictures.
===
@annamaria_jp @widely_ranged @GailSimone Shhh! Don't ruin the surprise!
===
@GailSimone Nightcrawler isn't a original X-man, he is from the second generation (third in truth, but the second no one cares), the original X-man are cyclops, Marvel-girl, Beast, Angel and ice-man
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone Wolverine isn't a original X-man
===
@GailSimone But it's my favourite also, I love this blue demon pirate
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography I think the best response for how frikkin powerful this Hawkwoman looks, I would like to quote this man. 

"Judas Priest!" https://t.co/3K3VavPyJV

@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography Keep posting, I'll keep retweeting!!!
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography I have some good ideas for variant front covers. 

See above pictures.

Would obviously also work as the main cover too.
===
See, this is true in a very Obi-Wan sort of way; were the X-Men REALLY the X-Men before Nightcrawler showed up? 

No, of course not. https://t.co/LGKT0hR9Qp

@Graciecosplay @JusticeTitanH @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography Love your cosplay of her, well done! üëèüëèüëèüëèüëè

@GailSimone I think Gail is trolling us
===
@GailSimone Nightcrawler is from the Netherlands
===
@perma_grinning @GailSimone You're thinking of Alpha Flight
===
@GailSimone The X-Men are Americans
===
@GailSimone Nightcrawler was never an X-Man. He was invented for Excalibur
===
@RRPatLaw @GailSimone The comic on the right is clearly a fake. You claim it came out in 1975. BUT, Beast was already furry by 1972.  So it's clearly a fake.

@widely_ranged @GailSimone Why do men always think this is a good idea? Do you have any clue who Gail is? Or could you just not wait to mansplain some shit?
===
@widely_ranged @The_Cthulhu_Kid @GailSimone Do you have zero idea how to actually correctly use quotation marks? 
Protip: what you're doing with them now? Not correct.
===
@GailSimone Gambit was never a professor. Not even an adjunct. 

He was a guest lecturer, though, which is where the confusion may be coming from.
===
@Marco21Cardoni @RRPatLaw @GailSimone At that price, I‚Äôd say it was a reprint from within the last 3-10 yrs.
===
@mjonhanson @GailSimone You know Gail is trolling, right?
===
@GailSimone Forgetting someone? https://t.co/ImqQVO83iF
===
@GailSimone "It not you, it Gambit" - Professor X
===
@GailSimone Yep, the very first lineup - Nightcrawler, Maggot, Husk, Captain Canuck, and the Tick.
===
@GailSimone The one on the right‚Äôs clearly the original larger team, before they started killing off members to boost sales.
===
@GailSimone Dignity and Cyclops‚Äô heat vision
===
@GailSimone So not the one we occupy then?
===
@GailSimone some people are so stupid. he‚Äôs literally on the cover of the first issue ever?? üôÑ https://t.co/gph0XpO6ZL
===
@GailSimone Thanks, @GailSimone! For those wondering "What is this thing? Is it puzzles or comics?" the answer is yes! It's a graphic novel by @HayleyRabbit interwoven with crosswords by me and @holyhegemony. If that's your jam, check it out (but soon!). https://t.co/VDLGN4GvWg
===
@GailSimone Yikes. If this thread was an X-Man pretty sure it‚Äôd be called Trainwreck.
===
@DavidJonFuller @GailSimone Ohhh, well now I know, and knowing IS half the battle!
===
@GailSimone I love the Xman cartoon when they all change into cars, except that one pencil
===
@jimintomystery @GailSimone You‚Äôre right! I loved when they drank gummi berry juice and bounced all over the forest!
===
@GailSimone The one on the left clearly shows Cyclops using his heat vision, so I‚Äôm inclined to think it‚Äôs the original cover. What must have happened was, Nightcrawler is depicted mid-teleport. It‚Äôs really an ad for his power being the best of all the original X-Men.
===
@PMSchumacker @GailSimone Would love to see Gail write an episode of Harley‚Äôs animated show. Especially after she wrote the best episode of The Brave &amp; The Bold üëÄ‚ù§Ô∏è  https://t.co/33CNCNfIw9
===
@GailSimone I can tell some of you are new here... welcome to @GailSimone Twitter.
===
@GailSimone Of the original X-Men? I'd probably have to go with Sasquatch.
===
@GailSimone Remember the team Nightcrawler formed before he decided to recruit Prof X? https://t.co/Nxno0gFS0G
===
@owene73 @GailSimone Yeah, but he was just a baby and not a Professor yet
===
@GailSimone Is that a new word for Gwen's stone scone? Dignity?
===
@johnrsmithjnr @GailSimone Only difference is ... instead of running away she stays and glories in the results lol
===
@GailSimone Nightcrawler, originally created by Stan Lee and Carl Burgos back in 1943. Truly ahead of their time.
===
@HonestWill @GailSimone Wasn‚Äôt Thunderbird in the SuperFriends for a while?
===
@GailSimone It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre the laser pointer and they‚Äôre the cat. 
They lump at that little dot EVERY DAMN time.
It‚Äôs mind boggling https://t.co/lGocNCtKbQ

@sophygurl @GailSimone True. True.

@GailSimone No way, Night Ranger is the best night themed superhero ever
===
On today‚Äôs episode of ‚ÄúTrawling with Gail‚Äù https://t.co/JSQs4GHraY
===
@RealBrianCutter @GailSimone No, nightshade is a deadly poisonous plant. 

I must have been thinking of Nightlife
===
@CoryHavens @RealBrianCutter @GailSimone And who doesn‚Äôt finish off, he leaves for his sidekick Kid Dysentery
===
@seanoconnor77 @GailSimone You mean the thing which came out 23 years after X-Men did? The original team is Jean Grey, Cyclops, Beast, Iceman, and Angel.
===
@seanoconnor77 @GailSimone Easy, because he wasn't on the first X-Men team.
===
@DOSeatDog @GailSimone Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Iceman and Angel are the originals.
===
Watching @GailSimone troll comic book gatekeepers all day continues to give me life and is maybe the best thing going on Twitter.
===
@Graciecosplay @DCComics @GailSimone @comiXology @GilPhotography Tanagarian godness
===
@GailSimone He was cool, but I‚Äôm partial to when Apocalypse turned him into Nightwing
===
@GailSimone Favorite original X-Men? Snowbird for me. https://t.co/T31MqVbKGP
===
@GailSimone I mean, I can see how for many Guardian is the obvious choice, at least among founding X-Men, but for me Snowbird's backstory made her the more compelling hero. https://t.co/Fzjz93VW9k
===
@drwillsey @kirstenrourke @GailSimone I mean absolutely if we're expanding beyond strictly _original_ X-Men, but then we'd also have to consider one of these two early additions as well. https://t.co/TCWwi5R92K
===
@Drgnfly42 @GailSimone Um, excuse you, but some of the Xmen were planes and even dinosaurs! https://t.co/oz98ZAeqS5
===
@GailSimone This is amazing.
===
@Mike_77Martinez @UrsusArctosHor1 @JollyBaba @widely_ranged @GailSimone Don't forget the leader of the team, Ms. Lion. https://t.co/Hycdm3uQvv
===
@GailSimone I was also a fan of Colossus out of the original X-men.
===
@GailSimone Hell yeah he is! https://t.co/N5rJ2vtEdI
===
@Psychoblue9 @GailSimone he is the superior heat vision brother
===
@GailSimone my favorite original x-men is Havok who can shoot heat vision out of his chest and hands https://t.co/uxXBZ3kqP0
===
@GailSimone THIS IS THE ONLY CORRECT ANSWER
===
@GailSimone Sure nightcrawker is great, but my favourite from first class will always be marrow
===
@TomandreeA @GailSimone Slugs as in snails but they impossibly are too big for his body
===
@GailSimone No prof x is south African dude with giant metallic slugs for innards
===
@GailSimone yours and everyone's with good taste üßê
===
@GailSimone Always a toss up between Jean Grey and Iceman for me
===
@GailSimone Same tho
===
@RRPatLaw @RMOURz @GailSimone Oh, you are.
===
@GailSimone Gail-
===
@GailSimone Nightcrawler was definitely a Legionnaire first Gail.
===
@GailSimone Bishop and Artie are my favorite original X-Men.
===
@GailSimone *looks around* So, not from around here, are you?
===
@johnrsmithjnr @RealBrianCutter @GailSimone I love the Nightlife! I got to boogie!
===
@Drgnfly42 @GailSimone No, that was the G.I.GObots
===
@xSHOGUNDo @GailSimone He was hella fun in X-men Mutant Academy 2.  I always picked him over Cyclops.
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone Does Gail do this so she quickly knows who to block?
===
@GailSimone I am more partial to Sue Storm.
===
@Thrabalen @widely_ranged @GailSimone Angel? I didn't think they let vampires in comics during that era.
===
@GailSimone my fave original X-Men.. I mean.. https://t.co/0V3OLqnJ7M
===
@duckbozard @GailSimone I love Bishop and how he never knows ‚Äúwhat you talking‚Äô bout. ‚Äú I think the X-Men jumped the shark when they let the little red headed kid, Sam, join. https://t.co/chx1p1crEg
===
@Mike_77Martinez @JollyBaba @widely_ranged @GailSimone You're thinking of Videoman.
===
@GailSimone It's like the Covid vaccine. It may sting at first but soon you'll be all the better for it.
===
@GailSimone If we‚Äôre talking about the ORIGINAL X-Men, Cyclops for the win; for the All-New X-Men then I‚Äôm on Cyclops and NIghtcrawler‚Äôs team. :)
===
@LPWLeeds @GailSimone Is that slugs(bullets) or slugs(almost snails)?
===
@GailSimone That's Gambit's informant name when he's narcing on other mutants to the feds.
===
@GailSimone Most famously when he was giving them info on Hawkeye.
===
@SylentWulf81 @widely_ranged @GailSimone ‚Äúwater from the same ‚Äòwell, actually,‚Äô‚Äù is some powerfully funny wordplay
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone wolverine wasn‚Äôt an original x-men member.
===
@GailSimone Oh yeah, books didn't get up to 3.99 until 2177!
===
@RRPatLaw @RMOURz @GailSimone Yeah the team on the left was FlyBoy, Swing Set, Lady Mutant, Snow Wolverine, and Eyeclops... they are shown here fighting their arch nemesis Dr. M
===
@GailSimone You are very skilled at this.
===
@GailSimone I love that you get a kick out of kicking that hornet‚Äôs nest
===
@GailSimone Hell, yeah! Since this videogame.. https://t.co/JGb2Bp6fvR
===
@GailSimone It‚Äôs odd that in the one to the right, Jean Grey isn‚Äôt there but John Proudstar is.  When I started reading them (‚Äò80s?), Thunderbird wasn‚Äôt a team member that I can recall.  That price difference, though... üò¨... I think that the issues were 75 cents when I started.
===
@GailSimone Professor X is Jean Grey's grandpa who always has pockets full of Werthers every time he comes to visit
===
@Drgnfly42 @GailSimone That was a great show. I had all the toys. But my Wolverine always got stuck in Dump Truck mode and I could never get it back into Wolverine.
===
@GailSimone Gail chose violence today!üòÇ
===
Same amiga Gail https://t.co/m0u4RnC06h
===
@GailSimone I prefer Thunderbird. Just so many great stories over the years. https://t.co/7R0itkVflB
===
@GailSimone Some people say Gail's trolling tweets are a work of art.

I feel it is the follow up trolling tweets to the original tweet that add depth to the troll.
===
@GailSimone I'm pretty sure he's the guy that made the Powerpuff Girls.
===
I used to think that Professor Moriarty was just a fictional character in Star Trek, then I came across Gail and now I know that Roddenberry created him with her in mind. https://t.co/iiYeIbhWc2
===
@GailSimone I was always a bigger fan of the Human Torch.
===
@GailSimone Him and Sasquatch were my favorite original X-Men
===
@GailSimone Those X-Men don't look 'Giant Size' to me. They look regular sized.
===
@GailSimone My favorite original X-Men are Betty &amp; Veronica.
===
@jamesoneill83 @GailSimone Luke Skywalker was my favorite Thundercat.
===
@GailSimone Oooh...my favorite X-Men cartoon is He-Man.
===
@GailSimone Why don't the giant sized X-Men just eat the regular-sized X-Men?
===
@GailSimone @aceCourtBot render

@Skellman98 @GailSimone For Gail that‚Äôs any day that ends in y.

@widely_ranged @GailSimone Wait did you just correct her and you were wrong ? Wtf
===
@GailSimone This never gets old...I love itü§£
===
@GailSimone And like, the one on the left clearly references the original issue, on the right.  There‚Äôs a continuity, obviously, that they don‚Äôt want you to miss! Whatever happened to customer service like this?
===
@mithrasangel @duckhelmet @GailSimone Transitively, hips = facts.
===
@GailSimone What about Cannonball ‚ÄúBoom Boom‚Äù Guthrie, and his fraternal twin Sunspot Guthrie? Best original X-Men by far.
===
The sun is up, and @GailSimone gonna GailSimone
===
@GailSimone I don‚Äôt understand why these guys can‚Äôt see what‚Äôs plainly evident.
===
@GailSimone Comics are the best. Comics folk are the best, and that includes you too, Gail. :)

@GailSimone Anyone who didn't love @GailSimone before, is forced to love her now...

@GailSimone The old Flash, John Stewart, is my favorite.

@caldyr99 @GailSimone Forgot Adam X the X-Treme
===
@GailSimone How about Tweets about comics made by people who make comics? Those are pretty nifty, too.
===
@RRPatLaw @GailSimone You got it all wrong buddy, Nightcrawler was an original X-Man. The team on the left was only introduced years later to rescue him and his buddies from Krakoa.
===
@GailSimone Of all the Birds of Prey, Hawkman is my favorite
===
Mansplaining strikes again. Oooof. https://t.co/DBcRD8EFxK
===
@widely_ranged @The_Cthulhu_Kid @GailSimone Nightcrawler and Wolverine both appeared in x-men in the same issue in 1975.
===
@duckhelmet @GailSimone I thought that was hips.
===
@GailSimone Kurt has always been the best X-men - finally someone who vibes with it, too

@Manruss @GailSimone Needed a bit more BAMFing, but yeah. https://t.co/kw22Pomctv

@GailSimone Him an Wolfeen are my two favourite X-Man's. https://t.co/kikuUWjpXG

@tio_loup @GailSimone That‚Äôs obviously not true because professor x is on that cover

@widely_ranged @GailSimone You forgot spider man

@CMjohnson77 @GailSimone Yep same here haha

@GailSimone Was he always the son of Mistique and Magneto or did I halucinate that epusode of the 90s cartoon?

@SylentWulf81 @widely_ranged @GailSimone Oh no who covered wolverine with snow

Nightcrawler wasn't an original X-Man, Gail! You're thinking of Blue Devil, his brother. https://t.co/PJrJMQFjPu
===
@GailSimone Doesn't matter if you're a lawyer, Gail will set you right üôè
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone These are the original X-men. https://t.co/lXBh6uFAFV
===
@GailSimone Yup. He was just X-Man before and then he got a job teaching at Wolverine's school.
===
@GailSimone Eh, Nightcrawler is just Cyclops with better powers, a cooler design, a wittier personality, and just superior storylines in general.
===
@GailSimone Professor X is the blonde guy in the red shirt with the sword. https://t.co/5dHpzOyxIe

@GailSimone Wasn‚Äôt Cyclops an OG X-Men?

@GailSimone Facts don‚Äôt lie.

@GailSimone Saaaaaammmme! He's a sweetheart and pretty cute.

@GailSimone In which timeline?

@GailSimone assuming that there's an autocorrect problem in there somewhere

This just never gets old. https://t.co/2CWxqY7ANC

@GailSimone Jake Gyllenhaal was GREAT as Nightcrawler.
===
I just finished it. 

That should have always been the movie. 

I want them to fight a team up of supervillains. We‚Äôve never gotten that movie from any universe and DC would do it best. https://t.co/J97neDZfhY

@GailSimone I've been thinking about heat vision since 1994 and that's how I know Cyclops has it. You?

@thalass_sp @GailSimone Gail laying bear traps all over Twitter.

@GailSimone Torn between "Nuh uh, Gail! Nightcrawler wasn't an original X-Men!" and going "Damn right, Nightcrawler IS the best X-Man." Because he is.
===
@GailSimone Does one need to have seen the theatrical cut of Justice League to enjoy the Snyder Cut?

Someone said Twitter Lawyer vs Real Lawyer is their favorite interaction. Mine is the "do you even Gail Simone" interaction. https://t.co/BhF3x1QqDV

@GailSimone he is one of the characters that makes me want to read X-Men. i really admire his connection with religion.

@widely_ranged @GailSimone She's written them, clown.

@GailSimone It's Friday again!

@GailSimone The funny thing about these tweets is all the people trying to actually explain this stuff without realising they‚Äôre talking to a bear.
===
@ChipThrockmort1 @GailSimone I did the same in college and learned never to say mein frend in germany?
===
@GailSimone There was a chocolate bar in the UK in the 80's called a "Gambit".

I don't know if that's relevant, but just wanted to let everyone know.

@GailSimone Mine is Rogue. Followed real close by Mystique.
===
@MuppetArmy76 @GailSimone That was the best X-Men cartoon, Optimus Prime was such a great villain.
===
@GailSimone Gail. üíÄ
===
@GailSimone I think Gambit and Rogue were in book called "Mr. and Mrs. X" so yeah- probably

@widely_ranged @GailSimone I hate draw water from the same "well, actually", but wolverine was an original X-Man??? You sure? https://t.co/TnIusjdPIt

@CarlosFreytesJr @Thrabalen @ThreeKobolds @widely_ranged @GailSimone Two on the same one is fun though.  Lol.
===
@CarlosFreytesJr @Thrabalen @ThreeKobolds @widely_ranged @GailSimone Eleventy Gambits.
===
@GailSimone He's the second Gambit. Dick Grayson was the first to call himself Gambit after he graduated from being Aqualad.
===
@GailSimone Here he is, clearly on X-Men #1.  I don't see Wolverine, though. https://t.co/HTfnF5KjwF
===
@Mike_77Martinez @widely_ranged @GailSimone I'm pretty sure the original X-Men were Iceman, Firestar, and their amazing friend Spider-Man

@GailSimone Alan Cummings was superb https://t.co/X2gxOcNjtc
===
@GailSimone Real fans call them "annie mays," Gail
===
@GailSimone Professor X was the leader of the Bionic X: Professor X, Mom X, Weapon X, Sport X, Rock X, and I-Q (sigh). They weren't "technically" X-Men but they appeared in all of the crossovers, I say we count 'em.

@ZombieHunted @Thrabalen @ThreeKobolds @widely_ranged @GailSimone I wonder what the record is.

@Thrabalen @ThreeKobolds @widely_ranged @GailSimone Every. Single. Time.

@GailSimone The funniest part of this tweet is imagining Gambit going through all the steps necessary to get an advanced degree.
===
Example #82837594937 Of @GailSimone‚Äôs brilliance. 

Reply Guy:

2. Tries to ‚Äúbut actually‚Äù her
3. GETS THE ‚ÄúCORRECTED‚Äù info WRONG

Amazing. https://t.co/sqfhjuVlXe
===
@EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone I feel Wolverine's design in the original lineup is underrated
===
@GailSimone Gambit is Professor X's evil psyche, who could only be defeated by going back in time and finding a younger version of Bruce Banner.
===
@GailSimone FYI:  He was originally written to be a new character on the He-Man show but Hasbro vetoed it :(
===
@GailSimone LOL you're the best :)
===
Found this gif while looking for something else and immediately think of @GailSimone. https://t.co/Hfqsbzd5RO
===
@GailSimone Actually, Gail, you‚Äôre mistaken. Nightcrawler was never a X-Men until recently. He started off with the Guardians Of The Galaxy.
===
@fencingmonkey @GailSimone You missed Eggs-man - he even looks like an Egg with that bald head.
===
@GailSimone I thought Professor X was Kurt Cobain, the voice of my generation.
===
@GailSimone No no Gambit is the one with the Scottish accent. Professor X is the sentient starfish. I think he's in the new Suicide Squad movie.
===
@GailSimone Night crawler and his lover mystique are two fine original x-men
===
@Matthew_S_Brown @GailSimone Jean Grey? I prefer her original name madame marvell
===
@PlatinumRoseL @GailSimone Thunderbird! https://t.co/VCsG2lVXn4
===
@GailSimone Gambit is the guy with the luck powers.  Professor X heads up the Doom Patrol.
===
@EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Nah, Ramona Flowers was the best one.
===
@GailSimone Yeah, but all the 'good' super heroes have been done...
===
@GailSimone Saaaame.  He‚Äôs the best. Cool powers.  Cool look.  Complicated morality.  Amazing personality.  The best.

Magneto for me. I mean, my pinned tweet says it all. üòÅ https://t.co/9Xn9jgSNHB
===
@annamaria_jp @widely_ranged @GailSimone About which part? 

There are so many parts.
===
@GailSimone Yeah if wolverine was an ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù X-man then so was nightcrawler. 
And that creepy Cajun narc guy. Chad or something. Ima say Chad.
===
@MuppetArmy76 @GailSimone Yes please
===
@GailSimone That's because he uses concussive teleportation and has a heat sword.
===
@chesire2050 @widely_ranged @GailSimone Hi Herb! Gail is an award-winning comics writer who has written for Marvel including Deadpool and Domino. She knows her Marvel, including that Nightcrawler is not an original X-Man. You are being trolled into mansplaining this to her. Have a good day!
===
@GailSimone You are a national treasure. Thanks for making @Twitter less shitty.

Gail really knows how to stir things up....and people fall for it every time. https://t.co/s8Errgasp5 https://t.co/JtrfWRZw6d

@GailSimone Tweets like this make me itch to join the discussion, but then I get sane again, lean back and enjoy the slaughter. Just because no one beats the queen in her own game.

@JoshROBrien @GailSimone basically, yes

@GailSimone I am Gail‚Äôs #1 fan I swear to god
===
@GailSimone His real name was Adam X. They called him "Professor" sarcastically.
===
@matt_heath @GailSimone Weren't they australian?
===
@Thrabalen @widely_ranged @GailSimone Isn't it adorable?
===
@GailSimone My favorite original X-Man is probably Captain America.
===
@GailSimone does he haver heat vision?
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone You‚Äôve been reading them since 1964 (or thereabouts) but still think Wolverine was on the original team
===
@GailSimone Original X-Men? I thought he was from Super Friends?
===
That's like saying a Manager or Editor is not part of the team.

Yes sometimes they may not feel like they are but... https://t.co/nVOrGxjqM2 https://t.co/ufdHlTIGp7
===
@GailSimone Oh Gail. The original X-Men were obviously Professor X, X-Man and X-23. The clue is in the name. The rest are their kids.
===
@GailSimone I think Professor X is that guy you see on TV all the time trying to sell you that big book of government loans.
===
@GailSimone Macho Man Randy Travis was the best
===
@GailSimone The original X-Man was Xorro. He was doing vigilante stuff and putting Xs on things with rapiers before Charles Xavier was even born.
===
@GailSimone I had the toy and everything. https://t.co/CiUYkBKa1V

@GailSimone I‚Äôve heard Gambit is a narc. Pass it on.

@GailSimone "Sit and listen here, mon cher, while Professor LeBeau teaches you all a-bout the love. It is a good lesson, mais non?"
"Gambit, put your shirt back on, you're supposed to teaching college-level algebra."

Hey, he‚Äôs my favorite as well https://t.co/dNZE16feOT
===
@GailSimone My favorite original X-Man is Blob, during that three seconds or so that they kidnapped him and told him he was joining up before mindwiping him when he said "nah."
===
@JWMCArtist @GailSimone You joke, but no joke will ever be funnier than the actual canonical reason that it stands for "X-tra power"
===
@GailSimone trollhunting early I see?

@GailSimone Professor X doesn't even have a super-power. How can he be an X-Men
===
@GailSimone Gail, you make angry tweeters like a master craftsman... https://t.co/Wo2xoYyJ18

@GailSimone I thought the original X-Men were Elasti-Girl, Negative Man 1, Mento, and Beast Boy? I don't remember Nightcrawler?

@johnrsmithjnr @GailSimone Night Ranger was an 80s hair band.

You're thinking of Nightshade.

@GailSimone Professor X is the lesser-known twin brother of Malcolm X.

@GailSimone I now feel 2000... because I was a kid in the 70s so I have X-Men 94... the New Uncanny X-Men &amp; GSA- X-Men 1... I think Nightcrawler was one of the first new X-men. I think.
===
@GailSimone Original? I never saw him in the 1963 line up.
===
@GailSimone Gail Simone posting to Twitter has the same energy as Wile E Coyote laying out bird seed except the trap actually works correctly every time.
===
@GailSimone I'll always have a soft spot for Morph https://t.co/1MrDzVBcyX
===
@rscottrogers @GailSimone Any other Aurora fans here? 
She was always my favorite
===
@GailSimone really? I prefer Red Sonja, but Kurt is great too.
===
@GailSimone While I liked Beast, Nightcrawler was my favorite too. BAMF! BAMF! BAMF!
===
@GailSimone Beloved writer, Master troll
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone Did you just mansplain the X-Men to @GailSimone?
===
@GailSimone Media does not start from where you picked it up Gail.
===
@MPLocke @GailSimone I was being sarcastic.
===
@GailSimone Well, yeah. I think this guy meant before the name change, when he went by Ice Man.
===
@GailSimone Gail!
===
Ah! You almost had me üòÖ https://t.co/MfPCondBwg https://t.co/oTPDnfB2HS
===
@GailSimone hmm... it is a good day to troll. &gt;_&gt;
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôm proud to have been successfully trolled by Gail.
===
@DAvallone @GailSimone Not too early enough?
===
@GailSimone The Beast because he was barefoot.
===
@benwoodtweet @GailSimone It was an obvious troll a lot of mansplainers fell for.
===
@GailSimone Next he's going to pull some garbage like "Cyclops doesn't have heat vision." Posers. https://t.co/eduMqtz8Je
===
@GailSimone Watching the comments https://t.co/Ij7oJzkjER
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone This is just embarrassing, herb
===
@GailSimone I love that this was a clear troll but the mansplainer had to mansplain and wasnt even self-aware enough to recognize the troll in the first place...
===
@GailSimone @Ubermensch1938 It‚Äôs amazing! 

#RestoreTheSnyderVerse
===
Taking another shot at getting @GailSimone to hear this song I wrote about kissing kaiju. It doesn't mention their taints but I think she'd like it anyway. #GodzillaVsKong 

https://t.co/WmhJHNjKf2
===
ignorance (about x-men) is bliss (about x-men) so i agree wholeheartedly https://t.co/98BYHlVQUM
===
@DomusCaligari @GailSimone You say that like it's supposed to be a bad thing
===
@GailSimone I loved when Steve Ditko drew him.  And Stan Lee's dialogue!  "BAMF, true believers!"
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone OMG dude do you have any idea? https://t.co/500A2xHlmP
===
@GailSimone I do too. I definitely came to like it more, on a rewatch. The first time around it was in a watch party with friends and we poked at it a lot. But the second time, I was admitting to myself I really liked almost every scene.
===
@GailSimone He was the only one that my mom liked because Catholicism.
===
Kitty Pryde has always been my favorite original X-Men. https://t.co/VqMrJXhCVt
===
My kind of trolling. https://t.co/30xrPKR1Ql
===
Every time I think about logging off, Gail chooses violence and sucks me back in. https://t.co/3fOiEYsQBQ
===
@widely_ranged @GailSimone Definitely not Wolverine. Much more likely Nightcrawler
===
@GailSimone But the best of the original X-Men is Betty White.
===
@GailSimone I like Judger Naught.
===
@GailSimone Nightcrawler was so good and really shined when fighting original X-Men villain, Mephisto.
===
@GailSimone I mean he‚Äôs right there in the first episode of X-Men: Evolution, which is the first X-Men thing.
===
@GailSimone Favorite Classic X-Man?

Beast.

He's smart, he's strong, and he's blue and fuzzy.

What's not to like?
===
@GailSimone They include Wolverine as an "original", but not Angel?
===
@GailSimone Oh my god üòÇ
===
The dream books:

‚Ä¢ #TheNewGods by @KurtBusiek, @j4ckherbert, and @thealexrossart. Getting the ol' Kirby Genesis team back together!
‚Ä¢ #Kamandi by @GailSimone and Ryan Sook. Their Kamandi Challenge issue was so good, plus Sook has a great history with the character.

#darkseid https://t.co/sBbl7f1ifb
===
Every day, @GailSimone wakes up and chooses chaos.
===
@GailSimone I know you're trolling, but I'm willing to believe that he was in at least one continuity.
===
@boymonster @GailSimone Even though it doesn't fit with the vision of The Flash, I really loved the "Just save one. [...] You'll know the rest" pep talk.
===
@GailSimone I cherish you, Gail.
===
@GailSimone It is Cable for me.
===
@GailSimone @GameSpot They did this nonsense with KOTM. It's a MONSTER movie ffs
===
@CMjohnson77 @GailSimone Watch Snyder's first. Then watch the theatrical cut. Hilarious contrast.
===
@GailSimone Here we go
===
Ye gods!  #Strixhaven's theme booster artwork features @GailSimone playing with twitters! https://t.co/r4cyE1KYe8
===
@GailSimone Does he count as original? (Mine too, though)
===
@GailSimone It might straight up be my favorite superhero movie.
===
@GailSimone Well, then. https://t.co/hsfmE5hSiX
===
@CMjohnson77 @GailSimone No, I‚Äôd say you don‚Äôt need to see any DC movie to enjoy it
===
@aboutageekgirl @GailSimone No wonder I love Gail so much
===
@GailSimone I thought you loved Domino?
===
@GailSimone Same. Also my favorite in the second movie.
===
@GailSimone "original" :D
===
@GailSimone Chris Claremont‚Äôs too...
===
You know we always recommend you take @GailSimone‚Äôs advice! https://t.co/k5SfvfnsAR
===
@GailSimone But have you watched Arrow yet?
===
@RobyEdmo @GailSimone Licensed to Ill is the best X-Man album
===
@GailSimone TECHNICALLY NOT ORIGINAL!

/Simpson's comic book store guy
===
@GailSimone A through W-Men don‚Äôt get enough credit
===
@GailSimone @flordefandom look at this!
===
@GailSimone GAIL.
===
@GailSimone But do you miss the uncanny valley Superman face
===
@GailSimone @GameSpot It's the whole King of The Monsters review fiasco all over again. Yeah, we know it's just BIG MONSTA PUNCH GO BRRRRRR. That's what de wanted.
===
@SavaniaGames @BoardGameAcad It‚Äôs true it does feel good to win, but there‚Äôs just something about it that absolutely drains my soul after spending hours plunging further towards doom and then it‚Äôs just like oh...I guess we lost them. It makes me disproportionately sad üòÖ
===
@EightAteEight @SavaniaGames @ddaviddx2 üòÆ how did you know the secret plan already? üòÅ https://t.co/nwHvkYOkxZ

===
@ddaviddx2 @SavaniaGames @EightAteEight So damn cool, although my digital artwork in print the smallest will be a pixel.... So.... How many pixels per inch should I print to? 999999999999999999?
===
@SavaniaGames @EightAteEight @ddaviddx2 Oh yes! That exactly. I had some micromachines but I don't know if they had mini car internal art on the inside ‚ò∫Ô∏è
===
@SavaniaGames @EightAteEight @ddaviddx2 Oh my god I love you all so much!   ...I wonder how miniature I can get the artwork for it to go... Are there any other board games that need a microscope to view the artwork 'properly'? üòÅ
===
@foulplaygamers @GeektopiaGames @playgames2learn @SavaniaGames @Tydaspy @erik_a_sunden @kovraystudios @jonesfamgames @TheEscapages @junkfood_games @Dravvin @CreakGeek @TheBoardMole @ufowavegame @BSoMT_2018 @MayflyGames @Maelius @Fallwood14 You definitely need a pinned post with the Kickstarter link üòâ
===
@EightAteEight @SavaniaGames @ddaviddx2 Yessums! One spot where it's 99999999999999 (until I get board of 9s) üòÅ
===
@GailSimone lol right. I had fun with it. 

Isn‚Äôt that the point at the end of the day
===
@GailSimone For real though, I love Nightcrawler.
===
@GailSimone I took three years of German in high school because of him
===
Why I can't leave this terrible website. https://t.co/SHqXItuCWP
===
@GailSimone More original than stupid Iceman for sure.
===
@GailSimone @GameSpot You say that like they were ever good to begin with.
===
@GailSimone Loved when Jake Gyllenhaal played him. Best of the X-Men films, imo. https://t.co/oil8Q6FdkF
===
@GailSimone And bears
===
@GailSimone Bold choice, but mine is Cable.
===
@GailSimone Jokes aside, he is the best.
===
Gail‚Äôs commitment to tormenting internet nerds is heroic. https://t.co/MufctEokl4
===
@GailSimone Is he the one with concussive blast vision?
===
@SavaniaGames Thank you. You too
===
@SavaniaGames @AtikinGames @ddaviddx2 So the game comes with pawns in every one of the Board Game Survival Kit colors. And a set of tiny miniature pawns. And a little bitty plastic baggie that looks empty, but I have faith that an even smaller set of pawns is in there. And look, is that another baggie inside?
===
@AtikinGames @SavaniaGames @ddaviddx2 So 300 DPI is fine for most of the board, but this section riiiiiight here is gonna need something extra.
===
@AtikinGames @SavaniaGames @EightAteEight "I wonder how miniature I can get the artwork for it to go..."

https://t.co/82NTbJQnlQ
===
@SavaniaGames @AtikinGames @EightAteEight I actually just found this guy because I was trying to find an artist that sculpts using dust particles. I remember he had to develop his breathing a certain way so it wouldn't ruin his art before he was done!
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôm a Wolverine fan myself
===
@GailSimone No one chooses violence on a daily basis as well as you.
===
@GailSimone Pffft. Get it right. He's called Nightwing.
===
@GailSimone GAIL
===
@GailSimone Beast Boy was my favorite
===
@GailSimone mine is booster gold
===
@GailSimone Mine as well
===
@GailSimone @GameSpot Which, you know, fine. We should all expect and hope for the best from our movies. 
But in this case I'm not here for anything the human actors are doing. They could have thrown up cardboard people cutouts and ADRed their lines by Ben Stein and I'd still watch the monsters.
===
@GailSimone I think he's a big worm.
===
Specially when he released his hit single PUSH THE FEELING ON https://t.co/PGRHDoilFH
===
@GailSimone Same!!!!!!
===
@GailSimone What about X-Man? I mean the team is named for him.
===
@GailSimone ‚ÄúDignity.‚Äù
===
@AtikinGames @GeektopiaGames @playgames2learn @SavaniaGames @Tydaspy @erik_a_sunden @kovraystudios @jonesfamgames @TheEscapages @junkfood_games @Dravvin @CreakGeek @TheBoardMole @ufowavegame @BSoMT_2018 @MayflyGames @Maelius @Fallwood14 Now that is clearly a very smart idea that we didn't even think about! It's a god job you're here!
===
@GailSimone I guess today I should have waited until AFTER lunch to look at Gail‚Äôs tweets. üòú
===
@lightwoodgames. This looks neat! https://t.co/O05xgXeaJq
===
I am part of (3) but I dream of one day becoming part of (2). https://t.co/4PP9PZRnwz
===
@sg15z @GailSimone @JesseNeon I'm waiting for Gail to write a Donky Kong spicy side tale called Konky Dong
üòÅ
===
@sg15z @GailSimone @JesseNeon Clearly, I missed something while I was eating lunch.
===
What are Fing Fang Foom's pants, Alex. https://t.co/CSdJtzidOD https://t.co/pd0Refo6ir
===
@SavaniaGames @PuppyShogun It sounds a little late but you might be able to toughen them up.
===
@GailSimone @GameSpot Seriously, what kind of person looks at Godzilla VS Kong and goes "I want more human interactions"?!

Unless they're mutant alien/human hybrids jumping about with lasers as they fight the Kaiju, they can sit to the side while the big kids duke it out.
===
@GailSimone Lol I was thinking I should take tomorrow off for it !
===
@GailSimone I was taking a drink. https://t.co/WGlkK9zLyS
===
@JesseNeon @GailSimone Follow Gail because you loved her work in comics

Stay for the kaiju taint discourse
===
@GailSimone Eww that means it'd have to be wet.
===
Same https://t.co/yzYr1uYTXo
===
@alwayscoffee @GailSimone Me too!
===
@GailSimone As long as you don‚Äôt call zucchini ‚ÄúSwamp‚Äôs Thing‚Äù again. We‚Äôre never invited back to their dinner party.
===
@GailSimone Daaaaaaaamn, Gail. https://t.co/qos5EhHYAp
===
@GailSimone I'm going to Google this and discover that Digni is Lipton's most microwaveable blend
===
@GailSimone (To the tune of the Godzilla theme) Dinosaur! Dinosaur! Monkey monkey Dinosaur!
===
@GailSimone @PaulJAndrew @GameSpot This. I sense their reviews are dishonest and just there to "shock" and generate clicks.
===
@GailSimone Who is this Dig Nity of whom you speak?
===
@cosmiquemuffin @GailSimone Beat me to it. https://t.co/P0I3RD0EEf
===
@GailSimone Zucchinis are classy AF.
===
@GailSimone Naturally. Bears are known to be among the most dignified members of the animal kingdom. https://t.co/EQ2iwpQR46
===
@doggans @GailSimone "Cosmo and I started out tapdancin in Vaudeville, using our heat vision to warm up our tea while the British audience would just use their microwaves"
===
@GailSimone The internet judges this tweet to be:

Fakey!
===
Gail Simone: HEAT BEAM LASER TAINTS SHARK FUCKING BEAR ATTACKS

Also Gail Simone: https://t.co/J0GzX0LFL7

@GailSimone Sorry, this is the first thing I thought of. https://t.co/kcjwYb54ga
