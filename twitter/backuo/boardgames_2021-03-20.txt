@AutSciPerson The topic for the essay I had to complete for my GED was "Convince someone why they should play your favorite game, boardgame, or sport."    My essay was graded as technically perfect but marked down to 450/800 for using a video game as my subject. Failure to follow instructions.

@ultrabuzzwole At least Jurota has a lot of wyrmprints, castle stories, dragalia lifes, and adventurer story cameos.

This is just a monster Jeremiah Robinson-Earl game. All-around, all across the board. Passing, shooting. REALLY good with his verticality on defense.

Shorty at the bar turns it on and walks away all mad. I’m eating enjoying the game and a lil squarely white man comes up to me  wit a clip board and ask me what’s my name.  Wit my chest I’m like “Brian Cooper Asst GM”. He look at the clipboard and hoe the tf out me

@NatalieClabo Also, plenty of long forgotten game designs from the 70's, 80's, and 90's I have yet to see mined. Still fun too. Some general ideas from board games could be translated creatively to Roblox as well. Hungry Hungry Noobs! Or, mini-games from old gameshows!

Okay, Kaito wants to fight Monokuma. I’m on board, and so is everyone else apparently. Is this really how the game is gonna end?

@Pcman211 @godplzHeLpFaSt1 Video game board games fail when they try to emulate them closely as people would rather just play the video game. I believe you have to embrace the medium you're working with and make a good board game above all else while embracing the IP and capturing the important moments.
===
Players start with one heart token, one free hit before the next KOs you. On the 1st hit, flip the heart token to reveal a '<U+221E> Speed Up' token, which gives you an extra action per turn for the rest of the game. Conversely Speed Up tokens gained from the board are spent once used.

@BoardGameSouls @BigGirlGames1 Dice Town is fantastic!! <U+2764><U+FE0F>

It's a full-fledged board game that revolves around a poker dice mechanism. Each player locks in a variable number of dice each round, until one player locks in all their dice, then everyone else gets one final roll.

@BoardGameSouls @horribleguild One of these days I'm going to have to try a modern roll-and-write. <U+0001F44D><U+0001F3FB> Right now the only ones I've really played, that I can think of, are Yahtzee and Catan: The Dice Game.

I also purchased Roll Through the Ages from a board game consignment sale, but have never tried it.

In addition to loving the Wild West as a board game setting and poker mechanics, Dice Town is great because it's really engaging.

After eight innings, the score remains the same. Tech had another great opportunity to get on the board, but squandered it. They're three outs away from their 14-game win streak being snapped.

and this isn’t to say you can’t criticize them! across the board, no one was really good tonight. lots of defensive lapses, they still aren’t playing as hard as they need to, not a great game from JT at all. but you don’t need to talk like the world is ending or the players suck

It's more akin to sitting down at someone's table and just listening to their conversation. 

Lurking is more like standing back and watching people play a board game. You're not directly in the action so no interaction is expected.

To just put it in a much better way, nobody's on the board yet.  We'll see if the second period of tonight's game will change things with one of the teams breaking through with a single goal for the very first time tonight. https://t.co/VttlePknwW

@TzarFenix @DasBrieger All they had to do was consider the locations on the board and then build characters around them, and find a way to make the children playing the game the heroes of a story involving them. One that had to include a Purple Pieman-like villain, of course (Lord Licorice).

@ariivory If there is good publicity people show up. Our HS girls team that I was the scorekeeper for was undefeated in regular seasons and we had crowds. Including an away game at a packed gym in a small town in coal country in Western Md. Current #ncaa board should resign.

UNC was two different teams in my opinion. IF they keyed in on D the game could look very easy. If you play solid D and board their misses you get steals, turnovers LAYUPS! Stopping ball and not letting bad switches happen. Not losing sight over helping and getting back doored.

This is a really fascinating debate of what is a game.

===
@tyrellan @FriedPotatoes42 @CyberpunkGame I could say the same to you. You really think it was the decision of the development teams and managers to work 100 hour work weeks to get the game to where it was? because if you somehow didn't know that happened, it did and the board admitted to it 
https://t.co/Q9bcdzpCmm
===
@tyrellan @FriedPotatoes42 @CyberpunkGame Yeah and as much stress as the lawsuits are at least the devs can finish the game now without having to deal with an angry mob, stockholders and board bugging them about the release. They get the time they need to fix and finish the game like no mans sky did
===
@glchickenboy @OregonRolledA20 If a player at the table just decided to try and murder the king, and the other players aren't on board, the DM can say no, or ruin the game. They want to play a joke character in a gritty game. No or ruin the game? That you think that is steamrolling is fucking absurd.

Hard to begin analyzing a game like that but that wasn’t great from Ulster. Still trying to force it at times. Some lovely tries but no real structure to the play. With a bit of patience, Ulster might have put a few more on the board #ULSvZEB #SUFTUM
===
note to self: never agree to play a board game with my mothers side of the family ever again ! spending upwards of 2.5 hours on a train game with two drunk middle aged women, a grouchy 14 y.o and an annoying 11 y.o on a friday evening after a long week of school was not pleasant!

This is actually a really neat render of how Wario's WL/VB hat looks like. I kinda want to see it come back in a new WL game whether it's default like before or a costume, it was last seen in Mario Party 10 via amiibo party on Wario's board alongside other WL and Ware stuff. https://t.co/1h13xCwGH2

Mr. James Hoeft, you are forever appreciated for being THAT teacher who put the game on...

He also had a gigantic bracket as his class bulletin board every March. https://t.co/MkOyem6AHI
===
@lawdog2k9 @jimtillery3 He's the consensus 3rd or 4th best LB on the board, and although he has very desirable traits, i still think there is some rawness to his game that may take some time to iron out

To me, if you are picking a LB that high(19 is high to me), they better be NFL ready out of the gate

@RichHopkins Indeed! It was the 1990 District 9 semifinals and due to a rather major error by the scoreboard operator (the coach of a rival school of ours), the score was wrong on the board in the final minute and we fouled when we didn't need to, costing us the game.

@DeptOfSophistry @gaijingirl2004 Ah yes, the board game that's satire gone horrifically wrong.

@catdix3 @BladeHattori @VGPNetwork @RobertsSpaceInd @VPGamers @ArtistSociet @ThePhotoMode Yup, also there are no loading screens in the game, you can seamlessly wake in an apartment, leave the rest area, catch a train to a spaceport, board your ship, leave atmosphere, reach near lightspeed travel and wander your ship while you ship is in quantum and it's all realtime.

@BFtigercast Given the age of several mids, and the way it looks bloody exhausting this year, Ross has to play every game. Time to weld that magnet to the board.

I like finding out who is befitting and what the End Game is.I am quite amazed though that the Tories (who are all about divide and conquer) have not got on board with this. The media, Nationalist socialist politicians,and hands-in-the-trough pressure groups have.
===
@DasBrieger @PuppyShogun @MarcusRoss Obviously by this date there were probably many other board games that had similar advantages over dice-based games. But Candyland was one of the ones we had, and overall was the most compelling game for our kids that also held a low cognitive accessibility barrier.
===
When @Hasbro or @mattel wins the bidding and acquires the rights to the #movielifespans board game that is being developed, none of the proceeds will go to @timheidecker !

@believeland6 Fair I guess. But as a team you shot 9 for 8000 from the line and let that kid scored 35 on yea. A last second miss hardly overshadows a terrible fundemental game across the board.

===
@cru028 @STRATT0NOakmont @MrPeckHistoryWS @KateRaworth The entire paradigm of land as commodity is fundamentally flawed. Nobody created land. We need to share, not treat everyone like Monopoly board game players. This is an evil system.
===
That’s what 50% from the line will get you. Can’t leave free points off the board. OSU didn’t deserve to win that game.
===
@mark_engelberg @DasBrieger This one is also very cute (I am a sucker for animal meeples) though I'd argue there aren't as many opportunities for storytelling as there are with Candyland. This is more of a skill/challenge game. Do love that it's very fast to play; we need more of those across the board.

@sadiei if they’re old enough (like 10+) and still interested in board games, i might tell them since they probably never considered that it is predetermined. it’s just a cool fact. young kids don’t care if people call it a game so i wouldn’t bother mentioning it
===
@sadiei @Polyversalis @DasBrieger but yeah, ultimately it doesn't matter outside of recommendations or organization tbh. candyland is still important in the history of board games regardless of it being called a game or not by us nerds, lol, and it fits its intended audience well!
===
@sadiei @Polyversalis @DasBrieger ... the board games in the board game aisle. and that's fine with me, i'd still categorize it under 'board games' since it's the same medium, it just is technically not a 'game.' like i wouldn't move choose-your-own-adventure books to the games aisle even though they are 'games'
===
@sadiei yeah, a deck is a nice way to add randomness to a game since it helps ensure that results aren't too lucky/unlucky. it's like a mechanic that forces the gambler's fallacy to be true! lotta cool, deliberate uses of decks in board games these days, like my fav example gloomhaven!

Good evening to board game players, people who help the host clean up, people who can't shuffle cards, roleplayers who can't do accents but try anyway, and the guy who always brings snacks to game night.
===
@fauxcroft @SpursWebSeb If he did that every game I’d be on board. Far too inconsistent. I would love to be proven wrong, but he just doesn’t look like he has the fight
===
@Genialgenius @ohmz @DasBrieger @PuppyShogun @MarcusRoss It's assumed from the analogies that you consider Candyland so far removed from boardgames it's ludicrous to talk about them together. But the common elements that classify it in the board-game family are actually huge and obvious. Embrace the fuzzy areas and corner cases.
===
@Genialgenius It's already a part of the board gaming hobby.  If you ask the first board game someone ever played, some will say "Candyland". It's made of board game mechanics and components. As a cultural pasttime it fits the common usage.
The element of choice is just one factor among many.
===
@Genialgenius @ohmz @DasBrieger @PuppyShogun @MarcusRoss I don't think so.  The key to the discussion is that it was designed to be played like a board game. If it ended up not fitting one strict definition of "A Game", that's basically just an unfortunate coincidence for the definition-makers.
===
@Genialgenius @ohmz @DasBrieger @PuppyShogun @MarcusRoss I mean, the thread basically opens by saying "I define Candyland as a board game. If you agree, this will be a useful conversation."

So adding a tiny bit of flexibility to the definition turned out to be a good thing.

@GailSimone Any suggestions for a good two player board game

@CBSNews See this women's team in the photo? One of these players has testosterone on board, which is illegal in women's sports, but you must suspend your beliefs and call this 'fair game'. Would this be fair to your daughter? You are REQUIRED to say 'yes'. https://t.co/rmGu5S3l6d

@breadslice772 @BucketJr1 I think they’re really great! They range in difficulty, but overall aren’t too bad. The controls are simplistic enough, but each game uses them differently, so it’s a good variety.

And of course the music is just 10/10 across the board, I love it a lot!
===
There’s a people management adage that suggests you criticise in private and praise in public. One question I have when large figures / platforms in the board game space criticise publishers for game design elements is - “could they have communicated this in private first?”
===
My discord friends usually play board games together on tabletop sim and I’ll probably join, but the issue is when I don’t think there’s a chance of winning, I’ll fully give up that objective and just attempt to cause chaos. Ex., catan sheep monopoly (bad endgame strat tho)
===
There's a big scoldy thread on here by a game developer that sets out to prove why people who say "Candyland is a bad board game" are wrong. But people don't say that. People say Candyland sucks. Candyland does suck. Big difference!

@Sam_Vecenie Thoughts on Justin Smith as a potential 2nd rounder? Or even Top 100 for your big board? Just a monster defensively and his shot shows some potential. A little Shawn Marion to his game.

There is potentially drama, I suppose, but it is fake drama because short of leaving before the game ends, nothing you do has any impact on the board. Anyway, that is probably enough about that.

It does prepare very young potential gamers for what a board game session looks and feels like, but largely kicks the idea of learning mechanics beyond, look at this card and do what it says. There are no elements of chance, meaning that most will grow out of it fairly quickly.

@ScottMorrisonMP you should fire your prudish classification board. This game is an artistic masterpiece, and you're letting a bunch busy-body nannystaters tell everybody what to do with their money. Not very liberal of ya. https://t.co/lTjNMeZtox

@StephShutt Lately it’s been gaming—primarily video games, tabletop role-playing games, and board games. I also enjoy anime.

I do also love reading but haven’t finished a book since the pandemic hit, although I have finished many magazines. I mainly read non-fiction.

@DLoesch @TheFirstonTV @PlutoTV There needs to be a Dana Loesch inspired drinking game.

Maybe a bingo board.

@ColgateMBB — @Bucknell_MBB should have told you to “wait until after the game to run your mouth.”  In retrospect giving @RazorbackMBB bulletin board material over a 2006 loss probably wasn’t the best choice. https://t.co/bzchQDOKxd

Up for real scrabble board game?

Feels like Florida would have won that game handily with a better coach.  They have the talent across the board to compete with anyone, whereas Va Tech's still in this weird post-Buzz transition phase.

@Tiedyed_Moose @Roman_Britain This collection is likely an assortment of pieces from a variety of games, possibly including "Knucklebones", a Greco-Roman spin on the modern game "Jacks". With regard to the board, the game is unknown. I could however be something similar to drafts!

We’re in OT of an NCAA tournament game, and Bede has 1 point on 0-1 shooting, with 1 board and 1 assist as your starting Point Guard and a 5th year senior. Utterly ridiculous.

@KMKTweetsNow @DasBrieger Probably supplemental. The idea would be that you go further and further up the board each game, and then go off the board into unknown territory

I think a valid strategy in a board game should be just straight up making out with your opponent when u start losing

@p_bov1 @NotoriousBAG_ @CelticTV That's cool but like you said. Lots of places could of hung it. Was for the European games, we get beat and the next game was the league cup and got beat in that to. The board had the fences up as well. Think they were still mad at the fans

It's been proven time and time again that the human brain is really good at not "crossing the streams" on a lot of stuff.

For example, games don't make you violent because your brain KNOWS it isn't real. This is just as true for the board game "risk" as it is for COD or CS;GO

@Mkhitargaryan @WeRTottenhamTV that’s ignorant, the team we put out can easily win that game if they put an ounce of effort in. i’m not saying the board is blameless because we have a long list of shit players. but that loss yesterday was not specifically down to the boards signings at all

Why would Anthony Duruji choose to miss both of those free throws !!? Hitting one of them would of ended the game. Instead he bricks them both, VT gets the board and drills a 3 to tie the game with 1.3 seconds left. #VTvsUF #MarchMadness

What game are you playing the most with your kids right now? Board game, cards, outdoors activities? https://t.co/H15TrMI6ry

TIL Candyland was designed for kids with Polio.
Also Candyland is a proto-game. It's how you get kids to learn the boardgame schema: take turns, draw a card, follow instructions/rules. Most other board games are a more complicated subclass of this. https://t.co/umCEg6Nryl

That monopoly game lasted 20 seconds <U+0001F602>

I honestly hate playing games with other people, they slow me down <U+0001F602>

Also how LONG does the set up on the switch monopoly have to be? Thought it would be an easier option than getting out the board but nope <U+0001F923>
===
@claus_maack @hsdecktech Secret Mage and the mirror are the only matchups in which this is worth the inclusion. You naturally want to trade your face into your opponents minions to fight for board however that often leaves you within burn range towards the end of the game.
