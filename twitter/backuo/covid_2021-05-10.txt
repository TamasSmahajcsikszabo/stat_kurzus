@helen0002 No. I wear a mask to reduce the risk of passing it to someone else if i have it but don't display symptons yet. I'll admit it's unlikely I do considering falling case rate but it doesn't hurt.

No, they're a bad thing, but necessary 1?

Oh yeah, then why does surgical mask work? 
  It doesn't, you just didn't catch flu because it transmits poorly

Ah

@dkwillabus @jljcolorado THEN medicine/ID/IPAC messed it up by saying for these LOW-RISK viruses (which we will call "droplet"), you are okay with surgical mask (because we say transmits in droplets).

No. Never okay that way. You are just not seeing infections because the virus doesn't transmit well
