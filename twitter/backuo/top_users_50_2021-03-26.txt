@RJohnston815 @peterdaou Getting the vaccine doesn‚Äôt prevent us from being asymptotic carriers to others who don‚Äôt have it. Also, none of these vaccines contain the live virus (like the flu vaccine), so getting the vaccine doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt get Covid - it‚Äôs meant to develop a better immune response.

@ScottWoodward38 @PAHealthDept Because one, the vaccine doesn't prevent you from carrying Covid-19 and spreading it to others. Two, if you're in the rare group that still gets Covid-19, while it won't be deadly, it will still suck and also be transmkssable. Three, vaccination takes time.

@devisridhar Panicmongering in the extreme- lots of people in this thread have stated why the AZ vaccine will  prevent severe illness from the SA variant, so its utterly irresponsible to say the vaccine "doesn't work" against it. As usual you are twisting things to push your zero-COVID agenda

@kirstjgallagher @Ignas13 @Paul1Singh The vaccine is 100% effective in preventing death &amp; 80% effective in getting seriously ill from COVID. It also massively reduces the chances of catching or transmitting it. The real threat to all this is the nonsense going on in Europe, ensuring an ongoing pool of infection.

@CroydonAbc @NUFC_OurClub @MartinSLewis Which is the same reason why vaccine passports won't work. There are always genuine exemptions and others will jump on the band wagon. We now have a vaccine, which will help but we also need to work on a cure for those that still catch covid.

@CNN So I guess the Covid vaccine is racist since you need an ID to get it?  

Anything the Left and their partners in the media don't like they label as 'racist' or 'right wing extremism'.

Does it explode and then shower everyone with the Covid vaccine because in that case this would be pretty cool. https://t.co/Wi27qeaK9l

Jeremy Vine is on the radio saying the Covid vaccine needle is so fine you don't feel it. Whilst I understand the trying to reassure people I did feel it I am sure (it wasn't terrible, I have certainly had worse, but I did feel it go in). Did you feel your vaccine?

Why do we need compulsion for the Covid vaccine but never needed it for any previous ones?

Just think about it, the flu one was only ever given to the vulnerable, and there's been some pretty nasty "variants" of that every year in the past too. https://t.co/MQZoHPWHmx
