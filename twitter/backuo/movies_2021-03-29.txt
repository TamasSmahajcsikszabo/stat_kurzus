The problem with HEAT is the problem with many films in this genre: the "relationship" scenes with wives and girlfriends are pure cringe. Cut out 30 minutes of that stuff (which is all sexist, they are trying to be big-hearted but it's terrible) and it's a great popcorn movie

@JoshFeibus No worries buddy. I think it is being honest with the story and finding ways to fit those in with the genre. 
Look at Monsters. It is in essence a monster movie, but underneath it is a love story that bubbles over allowing the small budget to still keep the expectations.

@jnthnwwlsn @mikenelson586 I'd forgotten the opening of that movie; haven't seen it since the early VHS era. I never considered it a proper part of the nukesploitation genre. Mistake?
===
@_FleerUltra They‚Äôre tangential to, or a specific subset of, my favorite genre: the problem solving movie. I could watch Matt Damon try to science his way off Mars forever.

the fugitive and michael clayton are the same genre of movie. i don't know what i'd call that genre but i know that i love it

worst movie genre is white girlboss ://

Since taeyong actor can happen at any moment. I think a psychological or thriller type of genre would suit him. I‚Ä¶ ‚Äî omg yes like a psycho serial kller who's charming and seduces people and don't even look lke they would harm anyo‚Ä¶ https://t.co/O6funCOppZ

You already playing a superhero in one of the the biggest cinematic universes and then going doing movie based in the action genre with smaller budgets and get confused why ppl see them and are confused and don‚Äôt rate it cus they could just see you as a super hero? Wrong!

Ahhh the YA-novel-series-turned-to-a-movie genre and the nostalgic disappointment that comes with it *3/4 of these movies were great tho, and yes, we all love Percy Jackson but the film adaptations really suck that I wish I was lying* https://t.co/0Y2azWimDG

@thocpodcast Shane Black is a genius of the genre; I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôve seen Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang which is his most perfect movie

@jrotcgeek1 The only criteria listed was "Jesus movie." Genre shouldn't make a difference. Go with Superstar!

@LazHimself I found this smaller movie that's within that genre and give me some Dead Space vibes: Stranded (2013). As a woman, that birth sequence was quite... impactful. Creeped me out. Bit of body horror there :p https://t.co/D0affmfxfJ

@apaullo95 Honestly that movie is just a masterpiece. üòÇ It‚Äôs real science fiction that isn‚Äôt afraid to colorful and funny, a sadly small component of the genre.

Very happy to be back for Dredd. When this bombed, I was certain my favorite genre was dead (The R-rated, mid-budget action movie made for adults.) Luckily John Wick was still on the horizon. This is the first, and to date only, 3D movie I've seen in a theater.

There's a lot of violence, nudity, and an attempted rape in it but it's pretty justified in the movie, it's not really meant to be sexy. It's a psychological thriller/horror movie, I'd absolutely rec it to anyone who likes that genre. The cinematography is a masterwork

Let's share our movie genre preferences üôåüèª

Name the best remake of a classic movie.

Name the best sequel.

Name the WORST remake.

Name the WORST sequel.

Name a movie genre you despise.

@MattKingwv @halloweeeeeeee @StephanieHorror Frank Henenlotter is every bit as much an auteur as Hitchcock, Kubrick, Cronenberg, Lynch, or any other director you'd care to name. He just gets no credit because he worked entirely in a genre that's not seen as "Art".
===
Scary Movie type parody is my favorite genre next to horror. Perfect example of my duality ‚òØÔ∏è
===
Need a movie to watch?

https://t.co/yIEvbMipzl is the BEST spot to look.

1) 5,000 movies and their streaming locations
2) Randomizer button can also help you decide
3) Filter all the movies by streaming sites, genre, director, studio, universe, and more! https://t.co/73bo9xw8jT

@Charlotte_Stein Right before the pandemic, I pitched a studio a movie with Fraser as the lead and they snubbed their nose and i literally said out-loud, LOUDLY-  - ‚Äúin this genre- he‚Äôs a movie star‚Äù and they laughed and honestly I‚Äôm still Fkn pissed. üò§
===
noir is literally my favorite movie genre icb baekhyun did this thank you so much
===
@ElyEelee Don‚Äôt really watch horror movies though anyway. Just saying people are fucked up for liking a genre of movie is pretty dumb
===
@Deprvty @NiceWigg I love BR, it's actually my favorite movie genre too. However, I can see problems with them and somehow that makes me a hater...
===
@joshualeclair1 100% both as a voice actor and screen actor, absolute comedy genius, will leave a big gap in the genre
===
@sweeet_tii @kvngkaaay @kindofabitcch @Divine_Amethyst @ylmarieeee It‚Äôs called Historical Fiction, it‚Äôs a whole genre of literature and cinema.
===
Rewatching.... missing this movie genre. https://t.co/JZq2Rl6ZZV

@ChillOther @Yaniezaki28 @crissy_2207 @FloraCMariano1 @pkthao39 @GermanaSales2 @netflix @NetflixUK @darrenchen_fan He is! You've got to see Theatre, watched it couple of weeks ago..
wasn't much into Jdramas and movies, knew him through YY too.. then i watched AIB, coz i like the genre and story, that's when i felt the need to see more of him.. üòä resemblance with YY is really a bonus!
===
(discussing kaiju movie genre requisites) Me: ...that mean Ghostbusters counts?

@DJHashMaze: I don‚Äôt know. You think Tremors does?

Me: No. They‚Äôre their own thing... like David S. Pumpkins. https://t.co/zG8dTRb7yK

movie suggestions pls :&gt;
(not a romance genreüò≠)

After yesterday‚Äôs 29hr found footage movie marathon I expected to wake up tired of movies but instead I‚Äôm hella looking forward to diving into Korean genre cinema blind spots on Criterion &amp; finally watching the very good and very depressing Russian film on MUBI b4 they go away ü§°
===
@LoggedinAmaad @Nilzrav @anubhavsinha I loved Ra-one, I'm just trying to tell the range of genres, Anubhav Sinha as a director carries.
Obviously genre matters a lot.
===
there's zero problem in talking about the issues of a genre and the people the genre steps all over 
the actress for Charlie from hereditary on tiktok talks about how people insulting her physical appearance and calling her ugly/scary in that movie deeply effected her
===
One of my fave types of songs in the soundtrack genre are when the song starts escalating to match how stressed tf out the ppl are in the movie/game. That "oh shit, we are totally fucked" vibe. Examples: the Kraken/Davy Jones theme, Xenoblade unique boss music, and Overtaken (OP)
===
@DentistGoneBadd I think the issue with musical theatre is that a lot of it is sheer rubbish, and this tends to be the more popular stuff. I would maintain that the genre has produced some exceptional stuff and I will always have a love-hate relationship with musicals in general.
===
@Babysky35307002 The movie was released at the cinema and sold 10,000 tickets in the first 48 hours. It had the most successful opening ever in this genre in Vietnam. Im so proud of him @sontungmtp777

B√åNH Tƒ®NH CH·ªú T√ôNG COMEBACK
#SonTungMTP https://t.co/FMHzZrYQSv
===
@cutetaeful It's a crime thriller and maybe it's not everyone's cup of tea. Hehehe. But yeah since I like this kind of genre, for me it's good. The popular actor on this Kdrama is Yeo Jin Goo while the veteran one is Shin Ha Kyun.
===
@_aizspace HSSJSJJS i used to watch it not knowing the genre when i was 12 literally had to pause in the middle im too afraid it will turn out to be a horror movie lol
===
i'll rec u survival genre movie abt sharks https://t.co/0bQUeig0li

Andrew is 100% right.

Also for any of you who like The Nice Guys. Watch Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. Same writer/director, same humor, and same genre. https://t.co/IF6Jv2cQT6

Pick 4 characters from the same genre you want to make a movie/show with. https://t.co/c12DwI5KIK

@elijahwood @_SpectreVision @MikeThornWrites Elijah Wood!! You are doing the most stunning work and I consider any movie with your name on it essential viewing. Thank you for making so many fabulous genre films. I am in awe of @_SpectreVision. Good taste goes a long way. Wishing you a great 2021, mate. Lots of success!
===
Every time I see this logo I know I‚Äôm going to love the movie that follows it. They always deliver. I‚Äôd love to work with them one day. So glad they are out there producing intelligent, stylish, high quality genre films. Long may they thrive. @_SpectreVision @MikeThornWrites https://t.co/a55yMPycVm
===
@xxsophiexx0 What‚Äôs your favorite movie/movie genre?
===
Wonder Woman 
Yeah so this is another one I still feel the same about after my first viewing only except liked Ares a bit more this time. I love the great genre blending of cbm and war movies. Not much to say it's just super fun a great example of what a comic book movie should https://t.co/UInYUSjkfC
===
I think because a Columbo baddie has to be not that likeable to work and the main characters of that teen movie genre are also massively unlikable
===
deciding my favorite movie genre is just ‚Äútom cruise wears a mask‚Äù
===
anyone has any movie suggestions? it can be any movie genre btw
===
This also the reason why I dislike Dementia as a genre with some few exceptions of a short 45 minutes movie or a short one court adaptation of Experiment Girl Lain.
===
On this day back in the year 1963, The Birds by Alfred Hitchcock was released and it has become a classic of the horror movie genre - https://t.co/mJavPaI6zJ https://t.co/Zv0mm52xE9
===
@CanBeOnly1Leage Hogzilla with @therealjoebob and @kinky_horror on The Last Drive In. It just confirms my theory that a bad, underfunded horror movie can still be fun to watch unlike most any other genre.
===
it's taken me 8 hours to watch this movie to how boring I found it. It's like 6/10 but definitely not my genre
===
@arun661 Personally, I liked #DoubleBarrel than #JilJungJuk which is of same genre. #LJP's most underrated movie!
===
Oh shit...I can't believe I never saw it before. 

The US‚Äîat any given point‚Äîis a simple equation:

Genre movie * Major League.
===
@TheCraggus @TragedyxGirl I have still never seen Zathura, must remedy that. But I've also loved the recent Jumanji films. I just think there's a space for a movie Twilight Zone type thing. You know the genre but everything else is a mystery. I guess Cloverfield is slightly that.
===
Next Best Actress and a great performance from Natalie Portman in #BlackSwan. Maybe because of a snobbish attitude to the genre, some don‚Äôt consider this one a horror, it certainly is, it‚Äôs literally nightmarish. Plus Mila Kunis and Winona Ryder, so you know, total babes lol üòç https://t.co/iFEhdyRhXO https://t.co/vehiyxYkjM
===
#ZackSnydersJusticeLeague has revitalized the comic book genre which had become very stale thanks to #Marvel and recent #DCEU movies copying marvel. @ZackSnyder has elevated CBMs by giving his movie depth, heart &amp; mythology. His vision has always been art &amp; ahead of its time.

@sooyeonthejung okay i‚Äôll tell you if there‚Äôs a movie i wanna see. but are you okay with horror genre, noona?
===
In my own perspective as a person who loves to watch this type of genre.The "Content Warnings" was implemented prior to the show and that's the most important in every movie or series. However, not everyone is oriented/aware of the purpose of having it. #JustSaying https://t.co/HTBmBzeKse https://t.co/4YZIl1FXzA
===
i thought pulp fiction was an entire genre i didn't know it was just a movie until the past year https://t.co/e4GBKGTPHU
===
@ijatoaj ü•∫ yes who will üëÄ you know our movie genre are the same üôÉ
===
The director uses the artistic tool of a supersized protagonist as a means of confronting patriarchal ideals within the thriller genre; simultaneously, by depicting her shooting upwards at the clock in such arduous fashion: it is now clear the liberated woman cannot escape time https://t.co/squVbV1iMG
===
@Charlotte_Stein The Mummy movie and Mummy Returns (must admit haven't seen the third!) are 2 prime examples of perfect movies within that genre. Want to see an adventure/horror movie done perfectly? Exhibit A üëç
===
So the movie's what you expect from a current day Hollywood Action Entertainment Product.

This ones hurt me because kaiju film as a genre (and I'm including every King Kong here) have a history of using larger than life nonsense to discuss heavy themes while evading censors.
===
@jegan11098 @actorvijay @Dir_Lokesh @Jagadishbliss This is one kind of a new genre I feel.. Commercial movie than but ellame over the top &amp; cringe ah illama still it entertains &amp; won hearts.. üëå
===
Everytime I watch it I just cried. The starting of why I love this genre of movie.
===
Watching 1932‚Äôs Scarface, and finding it both well done &amp; very much of its time, and definitely - tho so very different - very similar to the 1983 movie I remember. Really seems like a character study in a genre setting, good stuff both ways. https://t.co/fRvuoUfgKX

An Indian housewife with a gun is one deadly combination, ain't it?

===
@HashtagHeyAlexa They're the Linkin Parks of movie genres. Genre splicing.
===
@LegitTAYJ @KaiserPhenx It wouldn't bother them but they most likely would've enjoyed finding out certain details by watching the movie rather than reading it about those details beforehand on social media. Also how does the genre and it being the 3rd instalment matter to this topic?
===
@syeonyie Frankly, there is no specific genre I like. I used to watch something randomly, if I found that movie interesting then I‚Äôll watch it. However, these days I‚Äôm so into mystery movies. Do you perhaps have any recommendations for me, Syeon?
===
@TheStrxggler As some people have said: It's racism torture porn. In trying to address issues of race Hollywood has created a genre where all it needs to do is have a black character suffer racism, resolve nothing, and the director be showered with accolades.

@kalosresident yeah, S1 was epic, a spoof of the shounen genre + Madhouse doing animation so you know it was going to be good. S2 was blander story and JC Staff shorthanded the animation, they did soo much better on the Isekai spoof Konosuba movie.

As much as ZSJL was a great example of its genre, there's alot here to digest about how it came to be. How much has today's world taken away from people that they pin their lives so fanatically to a comic book movie? https://t.co/RmQQetx8kS

@TheBat_Family It‚Äôs also a weird statement as ‚Äúsuperhero movie‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a genre in and of itself IMO. There are superhero movies that are Drama, Comedy, Horror, Sci-Fi, and so on....

They are movies that feature superheroes
===
I‚Äôve never understood the hate for Man of Steel it‚Äôs easily the best Superman movie, &amp; I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs even close. The old Superman movies are staples for the comic book genre but Man of Steel is the golden standard for Superman films going forward, &amp; has been since 2013.

@NemesisFC2 @laurcunn @DT2ComicsChat @Shadewing @EddieSteak @CBNostalgia @CaptMarvelology @belet_seri @djairrick @johnnie_torch @CriticalBlast @DavidCosloff I guess what I'm saying in this long reply. Sometimes a movie isn't as good as others. It's not superhero fatigue, it's a movie u didn't enjoy as much. What other genre has this chucked in.
1 bad scifi movie doesn't create scifi fatigue or horror fatigue or comedy fatigue.

There's a German movie on Tubi called "Angst" that follows a fledgling, inept serial killer after he's released from prison, and immediately plans on killing again. It's a different take on the genre, and horror fans that don't mind subtitles should check it out.

Also finishing #TheLeftovers. Season 1 was a masterpiece, then it became pretty much a comic book genre. I mean, not much of an issue to be honest. It's done well &amp; Damon Lindelof is one hell of a writer/director. https://t.co/GCCsipT7YW

I'll refrain from saying anything of substance about the movie itself, but I love these paragraphs from Roger Ebert's review of it. Great allusions make for a great horror movie, probably because horror is a fairly discrete genre. https://t.co/lMBJoLke79
===
@WeirdNPissdOff People use this sequence to say the movie is flawed because this scene makes no sense. Duh it's a setup for a sequel it will make sense in the later movies. That's the genre now. They just acting blind to say something negative about the movie.
===
@mmpaquette @johnpike15 @Noahpinion @BeijingPalmer I don't watch many movies and when I do it's usually comedies. Heathers fits the f-ed up people genre. Raising Arizona. Death Becomes Her (very underrated). Any movie about high finance guys.
===
@TylerDestoroyah @BeijingPalmer Office Space is the only good movie in the American Beauty/Fight Club/Donnie Darko/Matrix genre. 

Election was great though. I should see the other movies.
===
Having grown up watching this genre, #Hukumat is a beautiful and nostalgic part of our childhood. This is the kind of cinema which drew our generation to distinguish between light and darkness. God speed and long live, @aapkadharam ji.

@mikewachowiak Dunkirk for me but only because I thought the different plot perspectives and filming inside of real fighter jets did more for adding something new to the war movie genre than the long shots of 1917.
===
@naunangmiya try death to 2020, the genre's comedy. knives out as well, a thriller, it's super fun. it's not really a movie but a kdrama, the penthouse, one word for the drama, stressful. enjoy watching!

TWS, Wandavision, BOP, ZSJL
Look at just these 4 examples and see the versatility. When will y'all realize that "superhero movie" isn't exactly a genre. CBMs are mixing different genres within the superhero format which keeps it fresh unlike one genre like westerns for example https://t.co/L0EGzQTZJ4

@icedxiu Yess!! Like his voice fits in everything?? An ost for EVERY genre,, i mean horror movie ? -yes. Romance/drama? - yes . Mystery? -yes. Kids movie? -yes. His voice fits to everything? He is so well trained and knows how to really use his voice is one of the biggest flex
===
People seek out certain types of content because they seek the patterns of emotion it gives rise to in them. E.g. movies in the same genre generate similar experiences. 

Why is the constant production of new ones required though? Why not watch the same movie over and over again?
===
@CathyYoung63 @StevenVolynets Another 48 hrs is a great movie, considering the genre. It got poor reviews because snobbery, I believe. And yes, Hill directed both.
===
What genre of movie would you call Forrest Gump, good will hunting, the secret life of Walter Mitty, etc.....?
===
On one hand, Knives Out. Amazing movie; a very well written and extremely fresh take on the detective genre, with super charismatic characters and a great tonal range. Just an absolute treat. https://t.co/IWNWXqvdOx

@kingere4 @SantosJRuedas41 @thedestroyer126 @JGftbl1 @ufc @travisbarker @kourtneykardash @meganfox @machinegunkelly What qualifies you for royalty in pop culture? A forgettable role in a movie the world stopped caring about, or being in a legendary genre defining band and making the Rolling Stones top 100 drummers of all time list? Is fox on the top 100 actresses of all time list?

@wongyukheic hi lucas ge! ü§© me read your greeting after kak haechans be like "jomplangnyee" anw i watched a lot good movie esp thriller genre but easily forget the tittle üò≠ i remember this one hv u watched the invisible guest?
===
@thebigspookyone I just wish more shit happened.  I'm glad it kicked off a whole genre but goddamn was it boring. The whole movie was yelling at each other and saying "fuck you" over and over.
===
@BrettClaudio It kicked off a whole genre and I will fully acknowledge that.  But the movie is truly about nothing.  I wish SOMETHING at least happened in it but it was just 3 friends bitching at each other and then 1 goes missing and the other stands at a wall.  The lore was way better.
===
@iichiiG0 We watched the 1999.  I will acknowledge it paved the way for the found footage genre but it doesnt hold up as it's own thing.  The marketing for the movie set the tone which made people think it was real.  Watching it now with none of that just made it really bad.

What genre is this #Movie bc it‚Äôs been pretty darn hilarious ü§£ lately!! https://t.co/wFvSHQabO3

You could ask me my favorite movie in any genre and I‚Äôm gonna say The Princess Diaries https://t.co/zNqLWHJzw7
===
my favorite movie genre is Unhinged Women https://t.co/XuZZxGpTuH
===
@EricDJuly Yes. But that hasn't been proven to be true in American comics as a sub genre. Not since the comic bust in the 90s. Manga is MASSIVE in Japan. In America it's the movie adaptation of comics that go crazy in sales.
===
@GaryBuh I love Peele‚Äôs movie work so far, I really hope he continues a deep dive into the horror genre. I think as well as he‚Äôs done so far, there‚Äôs a lot of potential for scaring people in new ways. Makes me think there‚Äôs a connection between the comedic mind and horror
===
Okay after reading these comments I‚Äôm actually horrified. I thought we were talking about like gorey horror movie genre stuff, people are ACTUALLY into real live gore? üò≥üò• this world scares me. thats not even a kink that‚Äôs straight murder https://t.co/nhW3Tt4wJZ

@icedeamericano Thank you ü•∫üíú the best part was it was unplanned! My one roommate was like do you want to watch a movie and I said okay what genre and she wanted animated so I was listing DVDs I own and she hadn‚Äôt seen Howl‚Äôs before (I KNOW) and then it became a Ghibli double feature night üò©
===
I could name half a dozen or more; it's honestly my favorite genre of movie.

I'd have to pick Napoleon Dynamite. https://t.co/04keZs7DBV

@RKliciousRonit One Actor Many genre. 
Baap Of Versatility üî•
===
@TheChuff_ @SMGarcia7 @MetalDawg89 @IOwnAPS5 @GameSpot Yes but considering it's a video game movie. A genre without a strikingly good and original film. 
They gotta take risks and put something new into it. Get the same level of meme. 

Trends are stupid anyways. Just saying that's the goal whoever can get it best
===
@carriejack03 Type of genre matter? 

If not The mummy or mummy returns w/Brendan fraser, not tom cruise. 

Spiderman:into the spiderverse. 

Any ghibli movie
===
Honestly it's a damn shame the chimps doing people things movie genre isn't as big as it used to be. Another massive sign of the decline of our civilization
===
rom-coms = my comfort movie genre.
===
NOWHERE TO HIDE (1999): As a genre fan first and foremost, I‚Äôm grateful for Criterion‚Äôs collection of New Korean cinema starters. I‚Äôd be lying if I said the film‚Äôs energy worked for me, but nothing is more fun for me than digging into the foundation of a cinematic movement. https://t.co/geMG8666HM

When Jackson gets cast in genre projects there's always the temptation to get him to ham it up &amp; lean into "I've had it with these motherfuckin' snakes on this motherfuckin' plane" Jacksonisms. But when he commits as an actor? Hoo boy. No one is better.

@thoughtfulbae Thriller/Horror

Prob the most inconsistent genre but every movie that hits HITS

I hope I can follow the plot of this movie , because I didn't understand at all watching the clips of it at YouTube. https://t.co/fDAYjvG2hk

i know video stores have mostly gone extinct because of streaming but i cannot fathom a video store would do very well by having sections divided by genre and then having every single movie be in every section.
===
@mrtnkeady I still have to read the book. I‚Äôve heard that the book is quite different from the movie. 

The 1968 film is a classic. 
Charlton Heston had a thing for the sci-fi genre.
===
Justice League: The Snyder Cut

Rating: 8.1

Lot to put in here. Very long, but over multiple sittings is worth it. Marvel has clearly created an advantage over the past decade in the superhero genre. But this movie has me convinced DC is making a push.

why is there never a happy movie, or a horror movie or movie of any genre with black main characters tht isn‚Äôt drenched in trauma porn seriously. https://t.co/FSWeNredk3

Another good review of The Box!

"The screen debut, which is not easy to make a global K-pop star who already has a fixed image into a movie star, is outstanding in its planning ability to successfully perform in the appropriate genre, theme, and character of music movies." https://t.co/ItSxxr1s4p
===
2nd movie: Birds of Prey. I thought it was actually good for the genre. I liked some of Harley Q‚Äôs outfits &amp; set design, the other characters are fun, it had just a touch of gore and ultra violence and a few cool fight scenes. The plot is forgettable but not offensively dum. üëç

My fav genre of movie is ‚Äútrippy‚Äù

@thecroakerqueen She was great in #Horror genre #movies. She really is #iconic to #tv in the #90s too. #SarahMichelleGellar #IKnowWhatYouDidLastSummer #cinema #actress https://t.co/KU03HwgRdh

@NNanpei @SeanSJordan You know, it‚Äôs not new but Autopsy of Jane Doe is a wonderfully creepy fun film. The Changeling (1980) is a classic in the haunting genre. Crawl (alligators!!!) is a very fun popcorn movie. The Eye (2002 not the american remake.) Ok, ok I‚Äôll stop.
