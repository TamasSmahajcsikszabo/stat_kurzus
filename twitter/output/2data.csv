1374784092089282561;@Dozibugger @tomjmegan @frazermac While I take your point @Dozibugger, and you're not wrong in principle, in practice the aesthetics of a tabletop game are an important, if sometimes nebulous factor, and no boardgame - however lovely (and some are lovely) have that kind of aesthetic.
