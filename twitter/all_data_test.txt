@MikeDrucker We are in!!!

Top tip:
Midway through the game made sure to move the whole board &amp; associated pieces/cards to another room to free up the table you were playing (so you can eat a meal or something).

Then move it back later.

Don‚Äôt forget to get a few cards mixed up/pieces lost.

@Pcman211 @godplzHeLpFaSt1 Video game board games fail when they try to emulate them closely as people would rather just play the video game. I believe you have to embrace the medium you're working with and make a good board game above all else while embracing the IP and capturing the important moments.

Players start with one heart token, one free hit before the next KOs you. On the 1st hit, flip the heart token to reveal a '‚àû Speed Up' token, which gives you an extra action per turn for the rest of the game. Conversely Speed Up tokens gained from the board are spent once used.

@Lost_Pause_ @Nagzz21 Chess is a recreational and competitive board game played between two players. It is sometimes called Western or international chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi. The current form of the game emerged in Southern Europe.

@BoardGameSouls @BigGirlGames1 Dice Town is fantastic!! ‚ù§Ô∏è

It's a full-fledged board game that revolves around a poker dice mechanism. Each player locks in a variable number of dice each round, until one player locks in all their dice, then everyone else gets one final roll.
===
@BoardGameSouls @horribleguild One of these days I'm going to have to try a modern roll-and-write. üëçüèª Right now the only ones I've really played, that I can think of, are Yahtzee and Catan: The Dice Game.

I also purchased Roll Through the Ages from a board game consignment sale, but have never tried it.
===
@BoardGameSouls @BigGirlGames1 Even if you roll nothing useful, there are special unique actions reserved as a booby prize.

In addition to loving the Wild West as a board game setting and poker mechanics, Dice Town is great because it's really engaging.

UNC was two different teams in my opinion. IF they keyed in on D the game could look very easy. If you play solid D and board their misses you get steals, turnovers LAYUPS! Stopping ball and not letting bad switches happen. Not losing sight over helping and getting back doored.

@tyrellan @FriedPotatoes42 @CyberpunkGame I could say the same to you. You really think it was the decision of the development teams and managers to work 100 hour work weeks to get the game to where it was? because if you somehow didn't know that happened, it did and the board admitted to it 
https://t.co/Q9bcdzpCmm

@tyrellan @FriedPotatoes42 @CyberpunkGame Yeah and as much stress as the lawsuits are at least the devs can finish the game now without having to deal with an angry mob, stockholders and board bugging them about the release.

@glchickenboy @OregonRolledA20 If a player at the table just decided to try and murder the king, and the other players aren't on board, the DM can say no, or ruin the game.

The indemnity comes from the feeling that by diversifying our reading, we have addressed racism. Exposure to diverse thought is a good in itself, but it is not an end-point. We've updated the pieces on the board but we're still playing the same game.

@lawdog2k9 @jimtillery3 He's the consensus 3rd or 4th best LB on the board, and although he has very desirable traits, i still think there is some rawness to his game that may take some time to iron out

To me, if you are picking a LB that high(19 is high to me), they better be NFL ready out of the gate

===
@DasBrieger @PuppyShogun @MarcusRoss Obviously by this date there were probably many other board games that had similar advantages over dice-based games. But Candyland was one of the ones we had, and overall was the most compelling game for our kids that also held a low cognitive accessibility barrier.

@cru028 @STRATT0NOakmont @MrPeckHistoryWS @KateRaworth The entire paradigm of land as commodity is fundamentally flawed. Nobody created land. We need to share, not treat everyone like Monopoly board game players. This is an evil system.

That‚Äôs what 50% from the line will get you. Can‚Äôt leave free points off the board. OSU didn‚Äôt deserve to win that game.
===
@mark_engelberg @DasBrieger This one is also very cute (I am a sucker for animal meeples) though I'd argue there aren't as many opportunities for storytelling as there are with Candyland. This is more of a skill/challenge game. Do love that it's very fast to play; we need more of those across the board.

@sadiei if they‚Äôre old enough (like 10+) and still interested in board games, i might tell them since they probably never considered that it is predetermined. it‚Äôs just a cool fact. young kids don‚Äôt care if people call it a game so i wouldn‚Äôt bother mentioning it
===
@sadiei @Polyversalis @DasBrieger but yeah, ultimately it doesn't matter outside of recommendations or organization tbh. candyland is still important in the history of board games regardless of it being called a game or not by us nerds, lol, and it fits its intended audience well!
===
@sadiei @Polyversalis @DasBrieger ... the board games in the board game aisle. and that's fine with me, i'd still categorize it under 'board games' since it's the same medium, it just is technically not a 'game.' like i wouldn't move choose-your-own-adventure books to the games aisle even though they are 'games'
===
@sadiei yeah, a deck is a nice way to add randomness to a game since it helps ensure that results aren't too lucky/unlucky. it's like a mechanic that forces the gambler's fallacy to be true! lotta cool, deliberate uses of decks in board games these days, like my fav example gloomhaven!

@StadiaRokks Thanks :) I planned to dive in at some point because I love the concept of the two worlds. 

The game in general got mixed reviews across the board tho, I‚Äôd love to be proven wrong but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be THE game. :D

Me: Buys a new board game because it looks awesome!

Also me: Never plays it.

@WellBuiltStyle When I was in Brazil they used to play a game called ‚Äúgay or European?‚Äù for gents who did this

@KristinRaworth That looks amazing!

I have a copy of the Fraser Institute board game, Poleconomy.

I can't wait for the pandemic to end so my family and I can play it.

Now I'm going to keep an eye out for that game.

@DasBrieger Curious what ppl think it is, if it isn‚Äôt a game?
I never heard of it growing up, but my kid LOVED playing it. We had a second hand board with no character story, which I didn‚Äôt know existed until now - she‚Äôd have loved that part too.

===
@Genialgenius @ohmz @DasBrieger @PuppyShogun @MarcusRoss It's assumed from the analogies that you consider Candyland so far removed from boardgames it's ludicrous to talk about them together. But the common elements that classify it in the board-game family are actually huge and obvious. Embrace the fuzzy areas and corner cases.
===
@Genialgenius It's already a part of the board gaming hobby.  If you ask the first board game someone ever played, some will say "Candyland". It's made of board game mechanics and components. As a cultural pasttime it fits the common usage.
The element of choice is just one factor among many.
===
@Genialgenius @ohmz @DasBrieger @PuppyShogun @MarcusRoss I don't think so.  The key to the discussion is that it was designed to be played like a board game. If it ended up not fitting one strict definition of "A Game", that's basically just an unfortunate coincidence for the definition-makers.
===
@Genialgenius @ohmz @DasBrieger @PuppyShogun @MarcusRoss I mean, the thread basically opens by saying "I define Candyland as a board game. If you agree, this will be a useful conversation."

So adding a tiny bit of flexibility to the definition turned out to be a good thing.

@CBSNews See this women's team in the photo? One of these players has testosterone on board, which is illegal in women's sports, but you must suspend your beliefs and call this 'fair game'. Would this be fair to your daughter? You are REQUIRED to say 'yes'. https://t.co/rmGu5S3l6d

@breadslice772 @BucketJr1 I think they‚Äôre really great! They range in difficulty, but overall aren‚Äôt too bad. The controls are simplistic enough, but each game uses them differently, so it‚Äôs a good variety.

There's a big scoldy thread on here by a game developer that sets out to prove why people who say "Candyland is a bad board game" are wrong. But people don't say that. People say Candyland sucks. Candyland does suck. Big difference!

if a motherfucker asks me to sit down for a board game and calls that 'spending time with me.' I am going to -fucking scream, flip the table, get in my car, and rip the fattest smokiest burnout down to the -rims- and i will not stop screaming until the world dies.
===
There is potentially drama, I suppose, but it is fake drama because short of leaving before the game ends, nothing you do has any impact on the board. Anyway, that is probably enough about that.
===
It does prepare very young potential gamers for what a board game session looks and feels like, but largely kicks the idea of learning mechanics beyond, look at this card and do what it says. There are no elements of chance, meaning that most will grow out of it fairly quickly.

It's been proven time and time again that the human brain is really good at not "crossing the streams" on a lot of stuff.

@A_LUIGI_ @ZenoKagemaru @Tekwizwa @OWAnonymous_ field is a start tbh if they change it. more fair play should be prevalent in this game. good decision making = getting rewarded. i just think they should do net nerfs across the board to lower power creep and oppressive abilities that nobody likes.

I spent about 30 seconds before making that move( Which is a lot of time in a blitz game).

Back them, give them opportunities, let them grow in their roles, they will provide you the results. Instead, what we have is an apathetic board that waited a full year to give them a game. All they had in between was an apology of an exhibition tournament.

@FootieWriter It's sometimes pathetic what we subject our players to. They could have many great runs of games and nothing I mean nothing in the way of compliments will be given them, but just one bad game and we slate them on the chopping board. Smh!

@SOUL_GIFTED Lol that's not how it works,  once a player is in the air you can't Have any contact, he looks over his shoulder,  sees him running for the board,  steps in his way then pushes his back when he's in the air.  A non- call would be blowing the game, that's a blatant foul.
===
@Vinciano_ Very clearly a foul.. you CANNOT touch a player at all when they're in the air going for a board or shooting, not even a little.  It's a foul,  even Randle admitted it was a foul in his post game but he was mad it wasn't called consistently all game.  Foul,  not debatable

Me: What do you think, should I spend $330 on a board game we've never even laid eyes on let alone play, that we won't get for a year? 

Brett: Too late, I already backed it. 

(Welp, so much for hoping he'd talk me out of it.)

@IntoGreenwood @KosmosGamesUK @ManOfNottingham Also on topic, I hve pre-ordered that board game, SOOOO stoked!

Finally got an offensive board and miss the layup right after.  Game over

@ChikoritaCheez Board the Platforms being stuck in the first game and no more Break the Targets really irks me.  Also wish the Spirits were kept separate from Trophies like the Stickers in Brawl, since they essentially serve the same function in World of Light and lack character descriptions.

@TylerStellman @shouldawouldaa @dinoclub_ @KevinOConnorNBA it was a soft ass foul with 5 seconds left in the game. regardless of the fact the chances of tobias harris grabbing that board is slim to none, if the game was midway through the 2nd, sure, but refs deciding the game is BS. let these dudes hoop

Knicks get absolutely robbed once again in a very close game that went to OT on an amazing shot by Julius Randle from the corner. Final 10 seconds rundown. Knicks up by 1, Milton misses a layup, Knicks grab board and refs call a loose ball foul on the Knicks(wasn‚Äôt a foul btw)

I have played the Stardew Board Game! Review: it‚Äôs beautiful! It‚Äôs also designed in such a way that everyone needs to really be on the same page and optimizing their strategy in order to win, which is pretty counter to the vibe I want from Stardew

@MingVaseDynasty Great point!! To be honest it is hard to justify spending as much time with the board game as you could just...playing a multiplayer Stardew town

‚ÄòThe narrow win takes us 3rd.

Five great games of #EDH today. Game of the day was Syr Konrad weathering an Arixmethes, Kwain, and Bravo pod through repeated recursion, board wipes, and lots of Ayara draining life. Mono black control is where it's at. Tergrid is too much for me but Konrad is the sweet spot.

Buzz, hate to break this to you sir but Dems are running the game board right now. Without the leadership of Trump to hold the GOP together, they are like a demagnetized compass and few like @Jim_Jordan know the direction of true north. https://t.co/BKlvQ6hGUd

@FinsOrDie There is no bigger sin this front office could commit than leaving Najee Harris on the board at 18.  Miami is close to contending despite a terrible running game.  Yeah, I‚Äôm sure there are gems to be had in later rounds, but Harris is as close to a sure thing as you‚Äôll find.

@tea_tabletop Yup, it‚Äôs in the instructions. Normal game scoring is - three colors in a group for a color button, matching the patterns of quilt to cat preference (usually a group or a row) for a cat token, and 3 tiles on the board for matching 6 hexes around the tile‚Äôs scoring requirements..
===
@tea_tabletop This last scoring method, the three tiles on the board...IS SO IMPOSSIBLE AND MAKES THE GAME BONKERS STRESSFUL!!!  So in the family game, the three tile‚Äôs scoring requirements are ignored, and you just play with colors and patterns.... which is calm and relaxing.

@markgoldbridge You maybe right but a Sunday league manager will make better in game decisions thn Ole. Yes you are right about the board but a good manager will at least win you a cup.

Anymore, I've realized that I seldom care for board games with expansions that add more rules ‚Äî especially if I haven't played the base game before.

They just get too complicated for my tastes.

The Pelicans have been the vastly more physical team all game. They also pose matchup issues across the board and are getting to the paint at will. I don‚Äôt think we can pin this one on the officiating. https://t.co/RiR3y18TEx

@moregamespls I have enjoyed what I‚Äôve played of it so far and it seems to keep to the spirit of the board  game from what I‚Äôve seen.

@TheNBACentral Am I wrong to think that impact on the game has more weight than defensive assignment? Who keeps more points off the board? Who do teams make their game plans around? Who actually plays BETTER defense?

Its ok i didn't want to win its ok. When you play like a stroke on the board mid game but the buddha gives you a lap dance its to be expected

@Denner7s I think it could be a good game for Moyes to put his point over to the board, the good and bad side of our current set-up. The subs bench was appalling for this level, there's no changes he could have made that would have won us the game imo.

My board game PRO list:

Rearrangeable map of some kind.
Cool looking game pieces or figures.
Organic winning conditions.
GREAT ARTWORK.
Weird or surprising theme.
Playable solo. (Thanks, Covid.)
Box that organizes game that came in it.
===
My board game CON list:

1) Generic meeples instead of real game pieces.
2) Cheap cardboard tokens. Especially if I have to punch them out.
3) Victory points.

Not absolute deal breakers, but definitely all things that suggest I should go look at more games.

@SaffronOlive @DrSamWaters1 Ultimately no.
If both have a solid board state: I agree that they (or I) could simply be thinking how to turn the game around, how to block efficiently, etc.
But if we‚Äôre both playing rather quickly until I clearly will get the win &amp; you burn 4 ropes: I‚Äôll gladly wait ftw üòé

@Vintage_Utd Fred is never as good a player as that described when people overly praise him after a great game nor as bad as he is slated after a game eg today. He had a shocker &amp; big part of why we lost but he is worthy of squad place. If board gets Ole Ndidi or Rice then it would help!

Players take turns placing 16 different pieces on a board. The one who completes a row of 4 "similar" pieces wins.

@ManiacHabs @marcplaysLoL @PuckReportNHL They don't call every penalty committed throughout game, genius. Refs routinely chirp players about cutting stuff out.

@Cipher_db That's what hand traps are for. Even if you can't stop your opponents combos, there is always a way to break the board. You just need to be familiar with what those outs are. The game isn't as cut and dry. The meta right now is back and forth. Duels do last more than 5 turns.

@CollinAshby @RickCarpiniello This is an awful quote. NHL officiating is bad, but imo the nhl officials have less of an impact on the game than any other sport, simply because an nhl official can‚Äôt put points on/off the board. NBA . NFL, mlb can put points on the board, but in hockey you can kill a penalty.

@Dozibugger Lots to be taken from board games and RPGs. My Sengoku battle rules take the command system from a board game, the battle campaign is run by a board game, and my solo skirmish campaign approach was heavily influenced by the White Wolf role playing games.
===
@Dozibugger @ReggieRaccoonOK @tomjmegan @frazermac @SvelhlauprDavid Possibly board game counters record more information. E.g. fight value and move distance. You can add up fight value and apply to a CRT. With figures, you wouldn't want to look up the values first and then apply to a CRT 1/2
===
@Dozibugger @TheByzantineGuy @tomjmegan @frazermac @SvelhlauprDavid Yes, I think painted miniatures can capture the imagination in a way that a board game can't. Even if that contributes next to nothing to the actual modelling, it still has 'value.'
===
@JTubesocks @tha_rami @Fletxaoscura @centristvoltron Play the games mentioned earlier or Frostpunk or Hellblade and tell me their stories would work better as movies.

@RadMrBlock @kwichiii that board game "Connect Four" is also called "Vier Gewinnt" in german.

@Dozibugger @jaje7406 @sprandell @tomjmegan @frazermac @SvelhlauprDavid In some ways board games represent the origin of the modern trend to "everything in one box" so beloved of the "bane on the hobby companies." However, if you compare to the cost and time involved in putting together a figure game, they probably represent a decent investment

@geekygaymerguy @FuntailsGames It's very simple. https://t.co/Z9YhuIXYj3 is specifically for background music while playing a board game. It's essentially a YT playlist.

@SvelhlauprDavid @tomjmegan @frazermac üëçüèº it‚Äôs a visual hobby. That‚Äôs one of the things that draws people in. And I also know that I can take one look at a board game and make a completely unfounded decision about whether I want to play it or not, purely based on a visual appeal. It‚Äôs the same with food, of course.

@jaje7406 @sprandell @tomjmegan @ReggieRaccoonOK @frazermac @SvelhlauprDavid I have a few GMT games. Each one needs a good chunk of time and focus. But probably no more than an equivalently immersive figure game. And we often moan about set up time for board games, but will easily spend the same time setting up our battlefields.

@tomjmegan @frazermac @SvelhlauprDavid We must remember, that the figures that we paint are really nothing more than blocks. Look at Kriegsspiel, which I still view as the pinnacle of a hobby. Is it more than a board game?

@Moiterei1984 @Dozibugger @SvelhlauprDavid @tomjmegan @GoatMajor I think my point was not to replicate what board games do, but try and think how you might represent information that board games commonly represent to the player within a figure game. My personal opinion is that "smart tables" might be something worth investigating

I'm so uncomfortable with the way that Sefirot tarot card board game uses Jewish mysticism terms. The creator might be Jewish obviously. I just feel like I'm boiling alive if you combine all these things because my Judaism is so insanely entwined with a non deterministic reality

Now we come to the board, and this is printed on the back of it. Definitely lets you know the style of game you're getting into.

Additionally, the last third of the book mostly just explains the various Kickstarter additions to the game you can use or not, such as the aforementioned chaoa board.

All in all it's not nearly as intimidating as you think when you hear '40-page rulebook'.

Wait, another board?

Had to check, but this is apparently a 'chaos' board for variant play that adds additional voter unpredictability into the course of the game.

@Dozibugger Yes. A board game is self-contained. A tabletop game is not and its pieces usually have much wider utility in other games of its period (folk will look at you funny if you start setting up Wellington's Battle using Waterloo's counters - and the game won't work).
===
@Dozibugger @tomjmegan @frazermac While I take your point @Dozibugger, and you're not wrong in principle, in practice the aesthetics of a tabletop game are an important, if sometimes nebulous factor, and no boardgame - however lovely (and some are lovely) have that kind of aesthetic.
===
@ReggieRaccoonOK @Dozibugger @tomjmegan @frazermac There's increasing 'crossover'. But it's like erotica and porn - you should know the difference when you see it . . . (and I grant you, part of that is a 'board' versus tabletop terrain, which is aesthetic. But how many boardgames use ruler-based movement? Not many.

@elavasam Hope he doesn't go the way of Thirimanne, the two Kusals, Chandimal(though he's still there, no real impact), Oshada etc

Windies and SL need to be strong for the good of the game

@legionofmyth That's certainly another way to go about it -- which I've also done, myself.

Matt Colville put it perfectly in the 'Pitching Your Campaign' video as well. Something akin to, "These are the games I'm ready to run, if none of these work then let's just play a board game."

Classic First Impressions from someone who was late to the game:

Removal way weaker, Minions actually stick. This makes more states where both players have stuff on board.

Not every minion has to be removed

Players run out of value

Taunt is far more valuable

@MMacDonald_Tax It‚Äôs also an excellent time to play Pandemic - a cooperative board game!

@BoliverPatrick @WillPresti Vera-Tucker had a pretty good pro day, not so sure it will be enough to move him up the board to #11. I like his overall game, but at this point I think Slater has the edge over him. However; it is possible that Slater could go in the top 10 along with Sewell.

#TheCircle  I used to think the board game "Diplomacy" could get a bit cutthroat. Manrika's two-faced approach - be nice to everyone, regardless of what you think of them, is brilliant for getting her past the other players, but may bite her with the audience vote at the end.

why isn't traveler the king, you ask? 

this is because traveler is most likely the pawn.

as i said before, the queen is the *second* strongest piece in the game. THE strongest piece is the pawn.

if you promote a pawn to the end of the board, it can become ANY PIECE.
===
now, the fun part - the theory.

if you lose your king in chess, you lose the entire game. the king is actually a very strong piece, but not on its own. it's the strongest in the late game when less pieces are on the board.

it can only move one space, but in any direction. https://t.co/sv1A5QF0Dm

What I think more competitive video games could learn from board games is that the game should be fun for everyone, not just the people in winning.

You need to really think about what makes your game fun, and then make sure you can do that  even if you're losing.

Very pertinent Q&amp;As regarding COVID-19 vaccination. 
Nutshell is that vaccine has been produced and marketed in a hurry without extensive field testing. Thus its results will be known after tracing people vaccinated. 
So same SOPs to be followed is better.

@DrRicketts1 @Lynette13751775 @Berry89508197 The risk of covid is not going away soon . And if you get covid the risk is much greater , not only of severe disease but chronic covid disease . In fact with covid your risk of severe clotting illness is far higher than with vaccine . So how long can you avoid covid ?

@ole_b_peters @sevendeuce89 @TSheri14 If a region doesn't eliminate Covid there is a chance it can mutate and thrive. Diverting vaccinations elsewhere before immunity may empower virus as opposed to reduce its territory piece-by piece. There's an argument for putting own oxygen mask on before helping neighbors.

‚Äî&gt; When freedom is restricted and people react by doing the opposite of what they‚Äôre told

Fact: Wearing a mask is easy 

It‚Äôs the squeeze to freedom that angers (scares) citizens

@Zubhaque There are people who genuinely can't have the vaccine. But the Covid deniers, going out on superspreader rallies, who unashamedly put others at risk at crowded venues? One person on our over 50s social group has caused fear for members scared of being near her. What about them?
===
@bryanvincent9 So you‚Äôre saying there are parts of the UK where individuals are paying for the vaccine? And as for lockdowns, no, they‚Äôre not easy. But having seen people lose those closest to them due to covid, including the loss of a family member... I‚Äôd disagree

@AnneMar24800060 @rosellacottage @waitrose Out of 29,000 cases, 909 deaths is about 4% fatality rate in infected. So 8 times as likely to die from Covid than have an adverse effect from the vaccine.  Let's not forget the chance of lasting adverse effects from Covid would then be higher still.

If he was in a wheelchair, wouldn‚Äôt they have to touch the child to assist them on the bus? Why would helping an Autistic child wear the mask be the issue? Why would you keep him on the bus waiting for over 15 min, waiting for permission to kick him off the bus?3/

@digitalspy Snyderscut is like watching Lord of the Rings two towers, Extended edition.... they cut all the best scenes out and added them in later? Which to me shouldn‚Äôt of happened. Why do movie companies spend millions on making a movie, and the cut out parts are the best parts of it?

Zack Snyder's Justice League ('21)
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê¬Ω
It plays like a mini-series rather than a film, &amp; I'll be honest it could've been 6 hours and still felt too short. It is a whole new movie though, inconsistent, w/ poorly written dialogue. Action is stupendous &amp; casting is brilliant

A few things on #ZackSnydersJusticeLeague.  There were scenes from Josstice League that were odd to me that were in the #SnyderCut. The issue was Josstice League had little to no character build up and no references to the scenes to make sense in the 2017 JL movie.

I don't know how we failed a generation of movie watchers that they think:

a) Marvel invented the idea of humor in genre films 

and 

b) that somehow moments of humor and warmth are anathema to "serious" filmmaking

@noticemeshizuns üôàüôàüôàüôà I mean I know it's probably a lil weird but idk I really like the horror genre a lot! not a lot of it is great tho so it's fun (for me) when a movie/tv show/book etc is genuinely scary

@itsRyanUnicomb @garfep Also just a 4hr movie by definition is bloated, especially in this genre. Even the Irishman, which was meant to capture an entire lifetime, was a half hour shorter.
===
busters. well I was born in the 90s and grew up in china and I guess I'm just not into that genre even though it's kind of a must see. I've also seen that zombie movie where bill murray did a cameo.
===
good genre of movie is: ryan gosling walks around and kills people wearing a cool jacket

Give me movie to watch. any genre

@lankyframpard A S. Korean film "Shiri", although heavily dated and extremely 90's, is a fantastic movie collection since it was hailed as the start of the S Korean action / thriller movie genre and stars some serious heavy hitters. The trailer doesn't do it justice and sadly is only on DVD.

@Gabino_Iglesias Have you seen The Borderlands, it's a 2013 found footage movie that sort of redeemed the genre for my girlfriend and I. It has the typical investigators from the Vatican archetype in it but flips it by making the believers skeptics and the only nonbeliever the superstitious one.

@3LVVIA It's just reverse gasous synth before at the end of the bar: this solified ossifiers in mainstream cinema have become genre-emotionsl giveaways. Since there' a resurgence of jungle in "underground" subgenres I expect it to be re-appropriated by Studios to connote menacing future

@RiphadeOnTwitch @EntInsider @hbomax Um, nope.

@fabiansociety The only other movie I can think of that even comes close is Easy Rider, and I don't think they really count as hitchhikers; and they didn't really do anything to them anyway. Harold &amp; Kumar sort of spoofs the genre but doesn't swap roles.

This is why the last 20 years or so of genre cinema have depressed me with their overwhelmingly bland, desaturated, color-shifted palettes.

-small character developments with the rest.

Would I say next-gen amazing? Nah, the movie is still a vision of 2017 (&amp; the time frame it had into making it from both directors); studios (Dosney), has finessed the Superhero genre &amp; story formula.

@JThomasOfficial I'm 100% with you, especially with genre films. Once I know I'm in, I'm done consuming anything else before the movie.

If I had a complaint about the movie, it‚Äôs that the whole genre has become very familiar, so even when it‚Äôs a true story it feels predictable, and playing it in an understated way like this one did doesn‚Äôt really grapple with that predictability in a way that mitigates it.]

@ayychris777 Yeah there are like very few ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù genre movies I have ever watched that I liked. Honestly only one is coming to mind and that was the Shack, but my friend ruined that movie for me because she told me that Mack is an Australian actor faking an American accent. I can‚Äôt 1/

If you're going to make a silly movie, fucking MAKE it.  It shines a light on how winking &amp; sarcastic so much of the genre has become. Movies made by people who think it's all pretty stupid. It may be. But I'm sick of watching shit by people who think they're above the material.

@AliceFromQueens I agree it almost certainly wasn't a hate crime, but just for the sake of argument... you don't have to be a proud, avowed racist to commit a racially motivated crime. Life isn't a genre movie, people don't have to spell out their motivations for the lowest common denominator.

@mattzollerseitz Maybe it‚Äôs why (some) men are so fastidious about categorizing / organizing their media, or why determining a movie‚Äôs genre can cause fights: insecurity. When someone‚Äôs insecure about something they love, gaining trivia looks like expertise, and expertise looks like maturity.

@sepia_cinema Serg, I know u are hit/miss with superhero genre stuff but I'm confident that u will dig @falconandwinter it's an extension of the Captain America: WinterSoldier film &amp; it was terrific. Directed by #MalcomSpellman (now I really wish his #Confederate wasn't canceled)

@GargoylePhan @AgnewRobin Yep. The movie series is based on this classic novel. Groundbreaking back then, it‚Äôs pretty gritty compared to the fun films with Bill Powell and Myrna Loy, but it really holds up as solid PI Fiction. It‚Äôs foundational to the genre. ‚ù§Ô∏è https://t.co/NXMK2LXhAO

American audiences are accustomed to seeing actor Mads Mikkelsen in the role of an evil‚Å† villain. So it‚Å† might come as a surprise to learn that his career was‚Å† built on art-house dramas, a genre he returned to in‚Å† the foreign film "Another‚Å† Round." https://t.co/JlgghEkhvK

#CallMeByYourName
I'm not a fan of this genre, but I like good movies. And this is certainly one. The first part it felt like it was a little bit too rushed, but the whole movie has this sort of oniric atmosphere, which is really beautiful. And the soundtrack is amazing.

This is the type of movie you just have fun with. The characters, while unlikable at first, eventually grow on you. The creature designs are also uniquely inventive. I have a soft spot for genre films in high rise buildings, I guess.

@GoodBadFlicks Though a personal tragedy, along with studio politics and a somewhat fickle public, hurt him, people who liked his vision supported him, and that says a lot. Zack Snyder is the Sam Peckinpah of the comic book movie genre. #ZackSnyderJusticeLeague #SnyderCut #ForAutumn
===
@grand_velocity @H11mGuy BvS is a Watchmen-style deconstruction of the superhero genre. If you can't handle Snyder's deconstruction approach to begin with, it probably won't change your mind. But UE does improve the movie a lot. Theater cut removed a lot of interstitial material for some plotlines.

Deep Rising is the ultimate exception to a giant monster movie genre in which characters are bland and the monster has character.

March 19th: THE WAILING (Amazon Prime). It's mad that we're nearly five years on and director Na Hong-jin still hasn't made a follow-up: this genre-smashing horror, a mix of MEMORIES OF MURDER and THE EXORCIST, is one of the most exciting movies of the last decade. https://t.co/PASYPpiPGC

@bryanedwardhill One thing that's fascinating for me on this, Laurie Strode, Ellen Ripley, Sarah Connor front, is James Cameron was so successful doing an action sequel to a last-girl horror movie, he did it again when he did a sequel to his own entry in the genre.
He pulled off both, &amp; very well

@Ser_Jon_Arryn Exactly.  There's no Marvel movie to suck all the air out of the room. Meaning ZSJL has room to be given a proper watch and also room to have its themes fairly not have its light outshown by mediocrity that's stifled growth of the Superhero genre for a decade.

@MarissaLingen I recently realized my live action movie collection all falls into 4 categories (A) truly excellent movies, (B) hilariously bad MST3K-level movies, (C) nostalgia-flavored genre movies, (D) movies with Derek Jacobi in them, absolutely independent of quality, genre, everything.

‚Äú‚ÄòEnfant Terrible‚Äô is one of the more successful examples of a director biopic, but the familiar conventions of the genre eventually do a disservice to such a talented filmmaker.‚Äù - @YesitsAlistair #BFIFlare

@semccalljr 2. What is your favorite movie genre?
===
@lesyeuxdegyu i dont have anyone rn but based on my past crushes, they just have cool interests and we share the same likes in music and movie genre, i know its not that deep üò≠üò≠
===
@JL_Kdiamond With Train to Busan or not (and if you like horror, it's a really good movie so you should watch it) you probably have still experienced more K movies than we have.  So I think you are fine (but seriously if you like the genre it's a horrifically fun film). üòãüòÇüòÇ
===
@lauren_ash I love, in that whole movie, that that is the thing you have an issue with! I was so disappointed, I really wanted to love it. #CaptainMarvel still my favourite of the genre
===
@big_boy_berto @bleppyman @CockDAnnunzio They took out so much in the movie that couldnt be filmed‚Äî every issue came with a post-script from a different genre, exerpts from memoirs, newspapers, letters, etc
===
@benfroggo It's so weird that war has become a genre

I think one quote that keeps me thinking about this is from director and decorated war veteran Samuel Fuller who after seeing Full Metal Jacket said, "it's just another goddamn recruiting film." I disagree in ways but he has a point.

Yes!! Kingdom of Heaven Director‚Äôs Cut absolutely rips. 3.5 hours, so if you watched the Snyder cut you can‚Äôt complain about this being too long. Also it‚Äôs actually a historical epic, which is a genre we don‚Äôt get enough these days. https://t.co/xdMPdluKy1
===
If I were a famous director and someone made a ‚Äúlove letter‚Äù to  my films where some hack kills his idol and is then embraced by the city that scorned him, and called it a ‚Äòcomic book‚Äô movie, I might be down on the whole genre as well.
===
@JL_Kdiamond I haven‚Äôt watched it but still talk about the K movie industry. I have no doubt the movie must be good, but I am a scaredy-cat and don‚Äôt like the horror genre.
===
@JoeR3tro @WheelsCritic @HeadExposure It's kind of sad that there's still nothing in modern superhero genre that would match Blade 1-2 fighting wise. But to have this level of action you need martial artist as a lead. I love Mahershala Ali as an actor, but Disney screwed up not getting someone like Michael Jai White
===
Newsflash: it‚Äôs not going anywhere anytime soon, beyond that, if you make a good movie it doesn‚Äôt matter what the genre is, it‚Äôs still a good movie, but it all starts with a well written, seamless story and compelling, relatable characters.
===
@kyoilys @hyekyossi__ I simply loved her in this character..  comedy genre is tough to act but #Songhyekyo is such a great actress who can pull of comedy so effortlessly.. have doubt? Watch #fullhouse and #dots . Not every one pull off comedy easily

@BetterCallTyler @Only_Grey @xvawes @iamthatroby Once again, not every movie is filmed on IMAX
The movie wasn't filmed on IMAX cameras or in 4:3, it's just Snyder's decision and vision, that I think it's a poor one in relation to the genre.

@JL_Kdiamond I think it‚Äôs a fabulous movie and highly recommend it but it doesn‚Äôt qualify or disqualify someone. What a silly notion. Not everyone likes that genre. üôÑ

Film historians will look back at the #SynderCut as the day films evolved into something new. 4-5 hour event films split into episodes will be the future of the genre. WandaVision, Falcon and the Winter Soldier may also be cited.

Sorry, movie theatres ü•≤

@jbouie Honestly it played more like a clip from a snuff film. Every scene from the movie felt disconnected or tacked on. Way overhyped. Black Mass was similarly flawed (per the genre).

Zack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League is a masterpiece and a work of art. It elevates what a comic book movie can be to soaring new heights. It is the Lord of the Rings of the genre. #ZackSnyderJusticeLeague #RestoreTheSnyderVerse

@GeitnerSimmons Criterion curated a collection of Japanese Noir films, including Kurosawa‚Äôs High and Low. Intriguing to see how each of the director‚Äôs reworked an essentially American genre.

The movie keeps its tone light, almost family friendly, but its plot is solid and fast-paced. Stripped of intricate details, personality of the characters, violence and death-defying stunts, the film manages to come off as a cool genre of its own.

I came to movie fandom through Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel, then discovered genre reading AICN every day. Used early Netflix to watch Bergman and shit. Owned The Big Sleep. I think I *wanted* to become a film snob. But in the early-mid years of parenting, I fell off a bit.
===
Synder spent 70 million to do reshoots on JL cus his vision was non-comical, hard core version of the Superheroes that I don‚Äôt think works in those genre! Was it an improve over the original yes, but was it worth to reshoot the movie no cus it was basically the same...

Franchises are boring. They never assume a radically different perspective in each new movie, it's the same shit every time. The genre is more flexible than the writers/directors give it credit for.

We also only had black and white once, so why isn‚Äôt this action/superhero movie made in black and white for artistic reasons. Because it doesn‚Äôt fit the genre!

@deaconpunnett @coasttocoastam One of my guilty pleasures is watching genre slasher films and your guest's movie You're Next is one of this century's best. Not for the squamish, but very good and quite scary.

If you'll have a role in a movie or series, what will your role be? (say for example, the genre is Fantasy)

I think I'll be an innocent looking character at first, something like the protagonist's best friend, but is actually the mastermind of the chaotic events. Or a spy. ‚ú®

Honestly I'm shocked I didn't hate this movie. It's very long has issues but what movie of this genre doesn't... It's obvious Snyder has a roadmap that he more or less planned,  the disconnect with the execs would make for a good documentary. #SnyderCut

I have to admire how absolutely auteur this is, in some way. Justice League: The Zack Snyder Edition is like a Tarantino movie, if the genre he was doing a bit on was Zack Snyder movies, and Tarantino is also just Zack Snyder.

@lyrimia like if a show/movie brags about accuracy, and doesnt have it, sure it deserves some critique. But fantasy especially is rarely trying to be historically accurate and is a genre where one should be allowed to mix and match and create something new /because/ its fantastical

The true joy of silent cinema in the digital age is playing ‚Äòbaby shark‚Äô and ‚Äòtotal eclipse of the heart‚Äô on a constant loop for every movie depending on the genre. 

Baby shark for anything serious
Total eclipse for the comedies

I don‚Äôt make the rules, I just barely follow them

I watched this movie recently that while comedy is the opposite of its genre there was this guy who just has no idea how to interact with children and he said a couple very funny things
===
@deiasilva10 There‚Äôs just too many characters that needed to be touched on for a single movie, but given those demands, I say it was better polished than most films with a similar genre

Gotta tell ya, one of the best films in this genre I've ever seen. Thoroughly entertained on every level. Wonderful performances, sharp vfx, incredible sound design &amp; a riveting soundtrack.

Hero doesn‚Äôt want to take on romance genre after After cos he doesn‚Äôt want to experience the same things he experienced with Jo, with another actress. I said what I said.

everyone always mentions ‚Äúit has more content‚Äù but i never saw it this way, i just think it being released in 4:3 is a harmless way to help distinguish the movie visually from others of the genre and its own 2017 version and that makes perfect sense to me https://t.co/FCjengluf7

#ZackSnydersJusticeLeague is a piece of cinema history, that will go down in the ages as possibly the best film of the entire superhero genre.

#ZackSnydersJusticeLeague is the best comic book movie to date. It is every DC fan‚Äôs dream come to life! @ZackSnyder you made a grand, epic, and mythological storytelling for the iconic heroes we grew up with. The #SnyderCut is unlike any other in the genre and we want more!

BvS was a movie about how Superman getting stabbed was a consciousness-shattering tragedy of epic proportions never seen before, using imagery based on 9/11 AND Jesus. The X-Men movies have turned Holocaust imagery into a genre clich√©. Why get mad because someone pointed it out.

As someone who's an aspiring filmmaker and a major geek for this genre I want to express my gratitude to @ZackSnyder for this movie which will without a doubt go down as one of the best CB Movies ever made.

Haven‚Äôt seen a DC movie other than Man of Steel, and not even the original Justice League, but was considering watching the new one out of sheer curiosity until I saw it was 4 HOURS!?!  The entire superhero genre is so pretentious with its overflow of content.

My favorite genre of movie is 90‚Äôs/00‚Äôs movies that are suppose to be serious but now read like a d-rated comedy
===
@demonsocialist @mrleandrotapia @alex_shephard That wasn't your argument. The genre and runtime isn't in question when people are watching a movie at home. You questioned the ratio when watching at home. You're conflating everything now because you have no point. You're just an asshole who hates Zack Snyder.
===
My bet‚Äôs on a ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù ending that criticizes the makeover movie genre... 

while still capitalizing on its appeal because, well, it‚Äôs a remake.

The only movie that breaches the subject of time travel in a way I can begin to grasp is Arrival and it‚Äôs not about time travel at all. And, I say all this as a person who loves the genre, adores all things Dr Who, and thinks the Christ transfiguration was not unlike time travel

To be really honest, I preferably have Seokjin's actor debut in this genre rather than romance, or bonus, being the villain because I WANNA SEE ALL POTENTIAL EMOTION AND EXPRESSION HE CAN DELIVER. https://t.co/xSrDGizyCu

@Poppytrixx I think a lot of men consider ‚Äúhot chicks‚Äù great actresses. Likewise, if your main genre of choice is big budget action films, do you even really know what makes an actress ‚Äúgreat‚Äù? They should just admit they wanna have sexy times with her &amp; leave it at that. üòÖ

I honestly think that The Snyder Cut will go down as one of modern cinema's boldest genre experiments. The same story of every superhero flick ever told on an epic scale and with the heart of an auteur. It's like if Scorsese directed Star Wars.

@danielrod1980 @KhameekJ03 Really close to a masterpiece, one of the highest rated DC movies on IMDB only after the Dark Night. Too bad you didn't enjoy it.. I for one can't believe we have an avengers move like IW and Justice League movie as ZSJL... Best of the best in the genre.
===
@EdwardGerman3 Same here.  I remember mom dropping me off at the theater to see the pilot/movie.  The part where he finds his parents‚Äô tombstones in post apocalyptic Chicago really fueled my love for the genre.
===
@KirbyAu Not that bad? No, no no, you gotta let this film stew for a few months and have a revisit. I would also recommend you watch other anime films from the 80's, so you can get the full picture of AKIRA's impact on the genre, the medium, and cinema as a whole. AKIRA is a masterpiece.

@sweisraneemm Have you ever watched a movie and there was a song (or music) in it that wasn‚Äôt your usual genre yet it fit, and because it fit you liked it?
===
Watchmen is satire. It's critiquing its own genre. Snyder just put comic to movie screen, and highlighted the parts he liked. But what gets highlighted affects how the movie is received. So even tho the source material is a critique, the movie is a homage to what's critiqued.

@glazedribeye @GameSpot I disagree with some things here. Saying marvel movies aren't cinema is a very general, absolute statement. They are cinema. They're just their own genre. Justice League is just a different style than Marvel movies, which I think is why people are saying it's "unwatchable"

In case its not clear, my point is that studios funneling more and more money into fewer and fewer projects is really what's crippling American cinema. Superhero movies are only the trend that was popular when this happened, but it could've happened with any genre.

Started to watch the justice league and it reminded me I‚Äôm not really into movie adaptations of comic books anymore. Wandavision is the exception. I think Hollywood has played that genre out with the million movies &amp; shows in the last decade or so.

@JBizzle703 @RichPointofView Yeah its not hard to see that DC sucks overall at movie making, and Marvel is damn good at it. And I'm not a big comic book/movie guy.

#ZackSnydersJusticeLeague is light years beyond what Joss Whedon and Warner Bros. sent to theaters.

@scottrenshaw @FrankYan2 Yeah, exactly. But also there's none of the usual disaster movie tropes so it definitely doesn't feel like that genre.

@Dave_the_Turnip @wordpressdotcom I like this perspective. I myself have fallen under that trap as well. How can you be sure if you love something if you haven't played every game that director/company has produced, or everything in the genre? It's good to just enjoy what you have sometimes.

@DoctorLongscarf 'The Dark Knight' is just a Batman movie (albeit a reality-grounded one). As much  as I love it, it doesn't advance the genre. 'The Winter Soldier' is a political thriller using comic book characters. That was doing something interesting and unique.

The way Ay≈üe's poetic monologues synchronized with Demet's style of delivering the extracts from Sanem's book was a genre of its own. Queens of ART and Literature. Never seen a writer-actress duo  generating that kind of power.
===
@itswilltime I agree, it's interesting to watch a different take on the genre. Marvel's formula has grown pretty long in the tooth. I hope WB/DC does what they've promised with The Flash movie and shakes up the continuity so they have another chance to get it right.

If you want your favorite show, game, movie, etc. to sound good just call it a deconstruction of the genre

For example, Final Fantasy XIV is a deconstruction of mmos, Chainsaw Man is a deconstruction of battle shonen, The Boss Baby is a deconstruction of children's animation

be characters and that's why a lot of Mecha's don't do it for me in the genre because they tend to be like Heisei Godzilla, glorified vehicles.

Kiryu shatters this issue by deploying some admittedly bizzare concepts that I still think work in the movie's context.

@mattzollerseitz @ponderer The problem with superhero movies is we began already ensconced in the post-Leone/Peckinpah deconstruction era having never had a Ford/Hawks/Mann golden age, so every movie is about how the genre is already moribund. I guess we're at the BIG JAKE/CAHILL/THE COWBOYS phase

@maldonsaltt Moulin Rouge, movie directed by Baz Luhrmann. Definitely a sub genre of ppl &amp; almost fringe theatre kids. The musical is either revered and referred to as ‚Äúgenius,‚Äù or received as an affront to the genre as a whole. There is no in-between.

@Animated_Antic I‚Äôd say, if you‚Äôre making a certain film, genre, setting, etc. you need to choose music that matches the mood, or vibe of the trailer, which should at least have a feeling that matches whatever tone you‚Äôre trying to give the movie!

.  I think the Justice League movie is proof Zack Snyder can put a great spin on live action Dc Comics franchise, in my opinion it's a quality mature content of the comic book movie genre adults can appreciate.

Its probably not an easy thing making a profit for a comic book film with a mature rating especially if the movie is not a huge joke such as deadpool but that's Zack Snyder's category of the comic book movie genre.

Horror films eternally offer a strange tonic of catharsis to us viewers. The freedom to purge our anxieties in a relatively secure environment ‚Äì the movie theatre, our living room.

===
@harakiristory maybe I'm sounding ignorant or it's a overstate but even their psychological drama doesn't seem sincere which is a very emotional genre (there may be good rare cases of good movies). non-english movie's are ahead
===
@thebrainofchris Aye to be honest I'd much rather be watching a Marvel movie at this point, even Wonder Woman. Disaster Movie is its own genre entirely distinct from SFF true, but my interest in it now I'm old and cynical is very low!
===
@JonHarless21 @Gwenharless @kinky_horror @SetDarcyFree @MasterGio @RedDogStudios86 My late mother's favorite horror movie and one of my earliest intros into the genre. Will always hold a special place in my heart!
===
@jayspatrol You‚Äôre a spoiled ass brat. It literally kicked off an entire movie genre.  When people talk about little@bitches who don‚Äôt know how good they got it, they talkin bout you‚úåüèªüñïüèº
===
@edroso ALSO, Booksmart just came out two years ago, but girls were at the center of that movie, but it‚Äôs straight up raunchy teen comedy. It‚Äôs so tiring ‚Äî what do they want? To have a specific genre to bitch about?
===
@FILMREN Actually the use of color correction is not about racism but about focusing on the genre and the theme of the movie. If the cc is warm the movie is probably action, crime story; if it's cold the movie will probably focus on a more intimistic dimension
===
I‚Äôm two hours into @snydercut and holy shit. @ZackSnyder please please don‚Äôt leave this genre. MoS was a masterpiece and so far this is on track to be another. We want and need (tho I don‚Äôt know if we deserve) another Snyder/Cavill Superman movie.
===
@nihilisticbeast @cactus_hate_you It doesn't matter what kind of genre it is with horror for me. They all make me freak out on a certain level. I actually can deal with splatter far better than with psychological things. Which goes basically for every movie genre out there.

@catboibee great pretender or pretty much any movie that fits in the sad romance genre like I want to eat your pancreas and a silent voice they‚Äôre always so nice to look at
===
@SashasOtherHalf || what movie genre do you like most?
===
This right here is one of the reasons why the Snyderverse must continue. Ezra Miller &amp; Flash were redeemed in this movie. This is why Zack Snyder must continue his universe. One of the best scenes in the superhero genre.

@CaseyLurtz @JamusLynch I hear that! It definitely is bad by 2021 standards. But as I said to James, compared to literally any other similar genre movie, the white people being the bad ones for disrupting the tomb, and the real good guys being the Egyptians, is vastly different than other action flicks
===
@JunkfoodCinema @scottEmovienerd @BriguySalisbury @willyswondermov @KevinLe81591457 @GOParsons Just finished this episode. You two need to do some kind of series together.

@pollackpelzner @StephenMarche @parabasis @KarenLeick @ZacharyLesser /Romeo and Juliet/ is an excellent example and forum for this: how does the play adapt standard conventions of Petrarchan poetry (a genre of interiority) to the public medium of theatre?

===
@fanofredwings04 @HungerforHorror @Sheena_655321 What does "predictable" even mean, tho? Everyone already knew the concept of the movie walking into it; the point wasn't to have some kind of Sixth Sense twist. It was a genre piece admired for its cultural commentary &amp; the way it was done, not the "surprises" (there weren't any)

@andraydomise @RickyRawls Man I hadn‚Äôt thought about this until I saw this tweet and column. But yeah, romance films are just... gone.

@almaazul75 üíú Interesting movie, Alma. Quite experimental in tackling the ‚Äúhorror‚Äù genre.
===
@RochardScott RDJ, due to no fault of his, hits a flatline. The character loses dynamism and stays in the safe space of genre, tropes, IP comfort zone. That goes on to limit what the actor can do. Wolverine's X-Men-X-2-Logan arc gives Jackman more dynamism to work with.

Ross Douthat writing a "bring back the romantic comedy" take in the NYT proves me right that it's a reactionary position; the romantic comedy as formulated in the 1990s and 2000s was the death spiral of a genre that had been one of the engines of Hollywood since silent cinema
===
@Wemusthaveknown I do not enjoy the genre my favorite horror movie is army of darkness
===
@bitterkarella it had a number of fresh, solid ideas, but it lacked direction. if production had been straightened out and the movie rejiggered for a slightly older audience, with the darker elements not being compromised, it could've been a genre classic.

@Chriss_m &gt;Your mind and senses should be ready for a challenge.

@jobosonchisa If the movie could not be cut down to a normal runtime for its genre (~120 minutes) it was a bad movie right off the bat. Zack Snyder‚Äôs ‚Äúvision‚Äù could only work in a panini when everyone is binging TV at home. Even then it‚Äôs kind of a slog to get through.

i just thought of a movie idea, some dude meets Kevin Hart &amp; The Rock. some weird magic shit happens somehow and Kevin‚Äôs voice becomes the guy‚Äôs heart and Dwayne is the competing dick. and the tag line is ‚ÄòThink With Your Hart, Not Your Johnson‚Äô - comedy, romance genre.

If you haven't seen H you're missing out. The entire film takes place in what appears to be an abandoned basement apartment with two drug users in their underwear trying to kick heroin.

@ChrystalWRox I've never seen the show... the movie was, no joke, in my top 10 list the year it came out. It's a genuinely smart riff on the Superhero genre, has the darkest scene in any recent DC movie and has this incredible musical number that's just... great https://t.co/xqnQkzgUtP

That, plus very early Chow Yun-Fat in Hard Boiled - Best of the genre IMHO

@rokugango Yes the story is bomb as hell and it's very anti-shonen. Shonen is moving away from the corny tropes and going into full on horror anime genre because they see how successful horror has been in the past year in mainstream movies and Demon slayer movie success.

Justice League Snyder Cut thread: The movie is immeasurably better, and frankly, a completely different movie. If you're a fan of the genre, it is absolutely worth a watch.

If you're not a fan, it's probably not as general-public friendly as say, Iron Man or Black Panther. (1/n)

I don't think there has ever been a movie like #TheSnyderCut Justice League. A completely unfiltered vision of a filmmaker who is unique in the superhero genre. I'm glad it exists, and I love it...

Superman: The Movie (1978)

Everything from the tone and structure to the effects and story feel very dated. But in a weird way it‚Äôs also pretty timeless and still extraordinarily influential on the comic book movie genre today. A massively fun and delightful origin story.

I just watched a movie that aged incredibly well for the first time. 

Coming to America (1988). 

Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this movie is solely responsible for starting the modern black comedy genre. It started Eddie Murphys multiple people gag, among others.

I consider myself to be a movie buff, and I love watching all kinds of movies, from Oscar worthy ones to silly ones made by Rob Schneider.

@KEEMSTAR Think about it Keem. Comedy as a movie genre is pretty dead, BUT it's a common sub-genre of other movies. People expect Spider-Man or Ant Man to have jokes and be witty/funny. Action movies in general go for that balance of action, drama, comedy evenly nowadays.
===
The last four movies I have logged on Letterboxd I find funny. It‚Äôs 3 classics considered to be some of the greatest of their genre. Then the Ben 10 finale movie. I‚Äôm a man of taste what can I say! https://t.co/5ybunky7QB

@jasonkilar @hbomax With all due respect sir, when we say #RestoreTheSnyderVerse  we want to restore creativity and bring cinema back in superhero genre. We wish to restore a person's hard work who planned atleast 10 years ahead while sticking to the rich folklore of DC.

Like if I was making a movie (any genre) and had hundreds of millions of dollars, I promise you the first thing I would do is offer the most prominent male authority figure role, age 50-65, to literally the greatest actor who ever lived

@ParalivesGame Zodiac would be a cool thing to add. Also favorite colors, foods, maybe if they prefer the ocean or the forrest, favorite flower (also other paras could give that flower as gifts if they know them personally), favorite genre of music and movie, favorite animal.

I hate my love for the mind-bending movie genre sometimes it's 'damn that movie was dope' but mostly it's 'what in the sam hill did I just watch?'

@btwitsmorgana @lailamansuraolc It is not a failure ..it is an experience that every actor or an artist should definitely take in his/ her lifetime ..they always can't stick to their comfort genre..they have to evolve as an artist and try new genres ..we are saying that we love her in comedy but +

@munconvos movie genre

I have absolutely IDOLIZED the Muppets for as long as I can remember and this is a result of that. Jim Henson is more genius than I ever grave him credit for because here I am, a perfectly trained actor for a very niche movie genre. Incredible. This is a big moment for me. (2/2)
===
@bapIuv literally though... as much as i appreciate saw and what it did for the genre it resulted in a lot of directors thinking gore was an easy ticket to a 'good' horror movie
===
Like, this movie is legendary even in the "car movie" genre. It debuted the new Dodge Challenger, revolutionized car films along with 2 Lane Blacktop, and was so influential decades later that Audioslave did an entire video echoing the movie.

What's everyones "must see" movie. Looking for a mindfuck type of movie, but I'll take any genre if it's that good

@KaylaChowShow Batman Begins! 

I love that movie; it single-handedly reinvented the Superhero genre into serious films instead of goofy shenanigans. I could do without the "bat voice," but Christian Bale will forever be the best Batman.

@RGVzoomin @KanganaTeam Agree wholeheartedly with your views of the Queen actress...though one doesn't ascribe to the genre of cinema churned out by your good self!
===
Enter the Dragon was not a good movie.

Maybe it was genre-defining or amazing for its day, but watching it in 2021... just boring. The choreography is lame.

Yesterday, I asked about your favorite movie that shits on a genre and since no one mentioned it, here's a recommendation. This movie destroys the Bond films and the classic spy genre (I mean we also have Kingsmen but that's another loveletter) https://t.co/9OIwgmGLiI
===
What's your favorite movie that makes fun of an entire genre and what genre is that?
===
while books (of any genre) are preferred, her go-to movie selection mostly consists of rom coms. with all the drama, death, and destruction normal life brings, the fantasy of words and film always bring a welcomed comfort &amp; stability. though, if asked, she‚Äôll always claim action.

It's fun to think one day I can watch a movie in the right genre I like, eye-punching.

@theonlyJaReW @Brian_D_PB @vintage_katie_ When I watched Rogue One, I thought for a genre movie it was incompetently made. (They were better at it in the 40s-60s.)

@StillFizz Defending, yes, because you're detracting from a harsh assessment.

I can only say it so many ways: depicting an act is not a critique of that act.

@JFritzO_ @GT_ICON I kindaaaa see what you‚Äôre saying, but also, that‚Äôs the whole point of the movie. It‚Äôs in the shoot em up genre, so to expect anything other than shoot em up would be unrealistic. Personally it‚Äôs why I watch the movies, for the unrealistic action and fighting lol.

@yaoilynnx1 I think 90-95% of the actors you see in bls are straight men looking to use the popularity of the genre as a stepping stone to other things and know what's involved. I suspect few of them have actual passion for it. And that's fine as long as the actor gives it his all idgaf.

Spartacus: Blood and Sand - the series on streaming media, not the movie - is a tad...superficial...I know. (I'm not watching it for the plot.) But, the fake blood, CGI, green-screen backdrops, cartoon-like transitions, etc. Is this some kind of tv genre? https://t.co/CLRlTvZm2y

@bizmarkiedesade it kept trying to play songs from the live action lion king movie for me awhile back, in the midst of a bunch of indie rock/electronic or rap. i‚Äôm pretty sure a label can just pay to slip an album into a playlist regardless of genre or previous listening.
===
@BondHunterBond I either make a playlist of really big, dramatic songs, or I listen to Coconut Mall from Mariokart on loop. if neither of those work, I pick a random movie on Netflix of the genre I'm trying to write in, and pick the movie apart to see what I liked and what I didn't.

@aptshadow @BadWilf That's definitely PART of it -- it feels like a weird genre shift -- but at least for me that's not the main reason I don't like the movie.  It has a cartoony-ness to the action (maybe CGI overuse?) that makes it feel like a parody rather than a sequel.

@Amazing_Amy_W Great interview! I agree that it is so unfortunate how people discount horror as a serious genre. Kane mentions works of the 60s &amp; 70s. My favorite era for horror. Rosemary's Baby, for example! Amazing movie with a powerful undercurrent on gender, family, and reproduction.

The primal violence is savage even in 2021. FX movie magic with a hulking tactile weight, that acts as progenitor for the entire genre. Monster as rampaging beast, monster as sympathetic creature, giant monster terror, both animalistic kaiju fights and wrestling flair https://t.co/M2bFwjr3mK

@duck_paints @zmrfzn @sonsofMMA @ZackSnyder @Lesdoggg Not really. It is a comic book movie. The comic book movie genre has more fans than regular movies do.

@MoviesSilently Was this ‚ÄùThe kiss in the tunnel‚Äù or was that a different movie? There is  one in the early genre of having a camera in front of the train engine and then someone invented editing when the train went into a tunnel - a stolen kiss. Audience was mind blown. (Film school memory.)

@Tim_Pilcher @disneyplus I think what makes it stand out is that those elements are still in the movie, but not blended together, so it feels like it ricochets from one genre to another, scene by scene.

@_oliviagrace I agree. I can‚Äôt afford tickets for the Nash, the Old Vic + Travel. It‚Äôs the cost of a family holiday! Seen some amazing shows I would never have had the opportunity to see otherwise, reaching bigger audiences. I hope digital theatre stays as a genre. Now that it‚Äôs established.

@AppleTV I don‚Äôt normally respond but I watched this and it was gripping from start to finish. Very much in the genre of an ‚Äòold war movie‚Äô but very suspenseful

@mickymi51203446 @wxncxxg I understand that some SF and CSW fans feel frustrated, probably bcs they have high expectation for CSW after the success of SF &amp; want to see him in more roles like that. But they really need to wake up, CSW isn't the kind of actor who only play one genre.

#RangDe Review ‚ÄîFeel Good Romantic Drama

Overall, #RangDe offers nothing new concerning the story, but it is also engaging and enjoyable at the same time. The casting, visuals and writing do the trick. If you love the genre, it is an easy one-time watch.

@IndieRevolver Watchmen is his best movie.

Strongly disagree about his DCEU movies being bad, some of the best in the genre imo.

Rewatching Train to Busan with my partner and I'm really struck by just how good this movie is. How well paced it is, how tense every scene feels, and how it makes a joke out of most other movies in its own genre by just doing it so much better.

#TheOne first half is so much of facepalm moments which doesnt really allow us to be immersed in the movie. But the interval point is intriguing, seems like a shift from the genre. Lets see. So far, below average.

201. #KingsmanTheSecretService

This movie is just fuckin‚Äô spectacular. A brilliant tribute to the spy genre filled with excellent action and an equally entertaining story. A stylish and fun send up to the James Bond series that also pays its respects.

The Radio Rental podcast is a fun take on the ghost story pod genre. It is hosted by the fictional Terry Carnation, who introduces each story a la the Cryptkeeper. Terry is portrayed by actor Rainn Wilson.

@PanzerCrush @Rhymeswithbowl @artyomtopilin I dont think the buddy cop genre is as well known in the 50s as it is the 80s? Ha-ha. But the movie was dog trash so if it was modern, enjoy modern. 
Wouldnt want to be outdated, so just make edgy Batman a dummy who unsuccessfully fights Superman with terrible tactics, good take.

Your gripe with modern horror shouldnt be that folks are soft. People are just people, &amp; blaming your fellow citizens is petty and dumb. The problem isnt even modern films, since I'd argue we're in a horror movie renaissance with some of the best stuff the genre's had in decades.

If you don't like the genre, you probably won't like seeing that one trope again. And that's OK.
But don't criticize the movie for having the trope. Just say you don't like that genre.

"This movie did the same thing as all the other movies in its genre"

Yeah... that's what makes it a genre.
If you love a genre, you love seeing that one trope again. Sometimes, you watch a movie BECAUSE it has that trope. Sometimes, you're disappointed if the trope isn't there.

Laurie Strode is one of my favorite horror characters(which is my favorite movie genre, which is mostly dominated by women in leading roles)
===
@TheoDoesArt But you can be a movie buff who still has his/her own ooinion on even the most liked movies. Just because you really enjoy movies and watch them regardless of the genre doesn't mean you'll have to share the popular opinion.

Sam Raimi's #SpiderMan behind the scenes. Extraordinary camera work and practical effects in this movie paved way for modern superhero genre. Can't wait to see what the master has in store for us with #MultiverseOfMadness

@ScottWamplerBMD I gotta watch Nimr√≥d Antal‚Äôs first movie again. I really liked KONTROLL at TIFF but haven‚Äôt seen it in years. He‚Äôs one of the closest modern analogues to the genre-hopping directors of the ‚Äò70s and ‚Äò80s.

Netflix Recommendation : Who's the boss

A lil cliche but it's interesting. In their defence, you'd really find a Romcom or romance themed movie without cliches.
It's a 7/10 for me and that's because that's my favorite movie genre.
I rarely give Nollywood movies a 5
===
@fiyyahhamed I woudlnt say I dont care for the genre cuz I obviously love fantasy but growing up the books nor the movie never captivated me at all and I just never got into it. But yeah I have seen a couple of the movies. I wont say I love it nor hate it. But I also wont watch it on my own.

@TobyManning @paulewart23 "Genre" I'm a linguist, too, always intrigued by these borrowings. Being a child of the 60s myself I was schooled on "genre" which came into English, at least in my times, from French cinema, "nouvelle vague". Not sure if academia is elevation. Keep tweeting &amp; cheers.

Holiday season might've been long past, but "Happiest Season" is a movie one can watch all year round. Even though the plot doesn't always veer off course coz of its genre, a stellar cast &amp; oddball characters make this rom-com worthwhile.

My favorite actor Kim Nam Gil   and Jin (@sissassy favorite) at one drama...

And the drama genre is comedy or dark comedy...

I'll start praying now... https://t.co/gSPFTm6U5f

I have absolutely IDOLIZED the Muppets for as long as I can remember and this is a result of that. Jim Henson is more genius than I ever grave him credit for because here I am, a perfectly trained actor for a very niche movie genre. Incredible. This is a big moment for me. (2/2)

@bapIuv literally though... as much as i appreciate saw and what it did for the genre it resulted in a lot of directors thinking gore was an easy ticket to a 'good' horror movie

Like, this movie is legendary even in the "car movie" genre. It debuted the new Dodge Challenger, revolutionized car films along with 2 Lane Blacktop, and was so influential decades later that Audioslave did an entire video echoing the movie.
