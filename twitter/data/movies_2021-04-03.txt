Thank you to @rsmon77 and #CultShelf for reminding me to get into #BlindFury. That was an instant favorite, and I really don't browse the Action genre nearly enough. I wish I could stay for movie 2, but sleep deprivation still wears on me recently. Adding it to my watch list.

hammer horror really made the phantom of the opera a moody old opera queen. the VISION. this is one of the greatest coups of villain queer-coding in 20th genre century cinema.
===
@GooBear91 @leilamechoui Saying that it sucks because it mostly deals with the same themes when it comes to a sequel is strange to me. I thought it expanded on the ideas that were in the first movie in interesting ways. Was it genre defining like the first? No, but that can't be the bar it has to clear.
===
@fulbreadenginer Honestly, when i saw the teaser i was like HELL NO NOT MORE BU üò≠ I'm still unsure if it's BU linked or if the movie is this genre, i haven't seen the Drama yet ü§∑
===
@wonderosa Anime may be the wrong genre for those hopes.

Is there a movie in the works though?
===
@fahir_me @voodoomaamajuju Even I thought so. But Fahad was bloodied without the gown and all. But in the end he seemed all cleaned.

I always get a feeling when I watch movies like these that the makers tried so hard at the start and just gave up towards the end to somehow finish the movie. Esoteric genre

I just have to say to all the people bitching about the story of #GodzillavKong that you've completely misunderstand the genre.  You don't go watch these movies for story.  You go to see giant creatures beat the hell out of each other.   This movie delivery of that was amazing!

Godzilla is my childhood movie star. I can never forget my time with the big G. The original movie is still my favorite movie of all time and stuff like the Heisei era films are just beyond amazing in all regards to the genre. Goji will always win! https://t.co/uG4a8dgQ6e

Don't go to a big monster action movie, and then write reviews about how there wasn't enough human drama.

@AJMacCruzin @SMALTKARNA @DangervilleTeam Idk, to make a good movie that would allow the genre to flourish and gain a new audience? Show the world that the kaiju movies can be more than just kaiju fighting?

My favorite genre of movie is "dumb and knows it"

@sloanesloane When I tell you there have been entire conversations, nay (neigh?) a whole genre of study between my partner and I about what constitutes a horse movie and what the best ones are. Love a good horse movie
===
@NickPiers I've felt the opposite. While I enjoyed the romp through the years of corny romcom tv genre, I wasn't all that 'into it'. The Finale was the best episode, and the use of 'Quicksilver' actor was a nice addition, but not enough because the implied meaning isn't the meaning
===
‚ÄúIt be your own people‚Äù should honestly be a movie genre at this point.
===
I don‚Äôt really watch movies either, but last asian movie i watched was friend zone and i think i love the whole story. It‚Äôs about two bestfriends who secretly fell in love with each other and at the end they got married. The genre is romantic-comedy. You need to watch it. https://t.co/opE0EpASfe

@AlexParkerDC Another I would, personally, consider a change in genre: The Hustler is film noir (very late noir, but still noir). The Color of Money is a sports movie.

@G4rdwin *tongue click* DUDE I LOVE THIS MOVIE ive watched it so many times. it and midsommar are my favs in the horror genre I probably like both of them since theyre by the same director.

I need recommendations for a long-ish movie that could be broken into three chunks over this  working weekend. Genre open (romcoms, my nemesis, aren't long anyway). I used to go for something "significant" on this weekend but one year watched Stigmata and then became flexible.

I didn‚Äôt expect to read this article today, but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one who misses this genre of music. Even though the songs have nothing to do with Pok√©mon: The First Movie, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a Miracle‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Say You Love Me‚Äù still slap. https://t.co/Tp95k1HBIu

@aprillprd Maybe watching movies!  If you recall during her early HBS series, she said that she watched tons of Netflix when the pandemic started.  She also watched a war movie called "1917" and loved it.  I don't think she would  watch a war genre on her own.
===
Cause that‚Äôs the part I like the most about the original movie, and while I think it‚Äôs valid to critique American militarist adaptations of the genre, I‚Äôm just wondering how much of the nuclear anxiety has survived fun of people just wanting big monsters to fight. Historically.

The Season 2 premiere of Shudder's Creepshow is as good &amp; fun as the show has been to date. First segment is bursting with classic horror love and the second is a literal Evil Dead fan film.

@AnsgarTOdinson Gaming's been consumed by "git gud" culture. People can watch more skilled gamers if they want. No need to go to people's streams &amp; insult them for how they play.

@queenfingers The original‚Äôs rape scene is over half an hour of the movie and both versions have her using assault/coercion as part of her revenge. Other films of the genre like MFA and Revenge handle the subject matter better in my opinion.

@joshgilley It‚Äôs like... they have no clue what a kaiju movie is about. At all.

But in all fairness, the genre is pretty new. Only been around for... *does math* 70 years.

@Michigan_Forged This is simply untrue

"interactive movie" genre?

Have you played God Of War, Ghosts of Tsushima, Final Fantasy 7 Remake, Last of Us 2, Horizon Zero Dawn??

They are just incredible games that blend the line with cinema, not "Interactive movie"
===
For some reason I find myself thinking about 1408. That movie has a way of crawling back into my mind out of nowhere every few years, and honestly I can't think of a higher badge of honor for a work of horror fiction. 

It's a masterclass in the genre and an absolute must watch.

@ronmarz Honestly there's a lot of culture and film history going on here that I wouldn't want to dismiss. The genre is considerably different than a monster movie. It'd be like... calling a Samurai a Knight. There's structurally little difference, but there's a whole world of difference.

@MovieKessler @Kryptobite On allegorical level because he harkens back to moment in movie history where comic book films became legitimate within main stream.

@DangervilleTeam While the fights are probably the best in the Monsterverse, ones you expend and put it next to others of the genre (Ultraman, Gamera hell even other Godzilla movies), they aren't really special.

Can you picture cast that similar to Star Trek Discovery/BattlestarGalactica/Etc to fit into Mecha genre like Gundam Iron Blooded Orphans/Gundam Seed/Etc tv show/movie if they were live action? Notice anything similar to what they wear? https://t.co/8qLjddpE7a

@MattGertz That's not quite fair, it's a giant monster movie. Cinematic genius isn't part of the genre. For what it is? It's a decent popcorn movie

@withenoughprep1 @TheLichMan2 @brookstweetz If you can‚Äôt see the social commentary of the real world that‚Äôs on you bro. Man of Steel and BvS flipped the comic book movie genre on its head. Watchmen was good, but the book is the reason for its commentary. MoS and BvS are different.

@b3rn1997 For sure,  I just feel like that‚Äôs a thing with the genre as a whole to where I‚Äôm expecting the humans to be boring and one dimensional. I think this movie was one of the best of this monsterverse because Godzilla and Kong had a good chunk of screen time

@HumongousPizzas They act like any Godzilla movie had good human character writing, the entire genre is big monster fights other big monster, the humans are just there to further the plot enough so it's not just a 10 minute monster fight

#Irul Review ‚ÄìHalf-baked Thriller

#Irul has an intriguing premise &amp; excellent performances, but it fails to provide an engaging &amp; suspenseful tale. The lovers of thriller genre could give it a try, but be prepared to be disappointed.

2. Watch any movie:
Judge yourself for any childhood movie you used to love. If not that, watch a new movie or a genre you wouldn‚Äôt usually be interested in. Or just go online and find a wheel in which you input the movie names and let fate decide on what to see :)

@Drumdums Typical Warner Bros Lee. Zigging when they need to zag. I can't believe they don't see the possibilities to do some different things in the comic book movie genre. Stuff to separate them from Marvel. It's an absolute shame.

she‚Äôs an amazing artist who‚Äôs vision I‚Äôd like privy too and I think her VISION* is a great inclusion to DC and the superheroe movie genre
===
@Darren_Mooney It's painful to see as I was excited for DC films to be a genuine director driven counterpart to the MCU where directors who didn't have a place in that franchise could still work and do stuff to push the genre forward

But WB wants to be like Disney and make easy fan service
===
@wyattyhalpert @R2IsGood I was really excited for DC films to be a genuine counterpart to the MCU in being a franchise which was willing to make more director driven films that would push the genre forward

I still believe they're capable of achieving that

The fake persecuted attitude that Comic Book movie fans have is literally the worst thing about the whole genre and it‚Äôs fan base. Sorry y‚Äôall, nerd culture is mainstream is fuck now, just like damn near everything else, even shit I use to love. Get a grip.

On this weekend's 24K binge, a genre for the ones who are looking for something different. Independent cinema is home to some of the finest off-beat cinema which aren't shown in mainstream cinema. Here are some of the finest indie films to get you started! https://t.co/IijoO7vfk0
===
I mean, we‚Äôre halfway through the movie &amp; no zombie invasion yet. Just a lot of flat characters with not much to do. And it‚Äôs a bit insulting towards small town America to boot. 

They‚Äôre trying for quirky deadpan &amp; failing miserably. Nothing new to offer the genre either. üëéüßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
===
@MarxIsMyNigga I love the implication that a movie in which men hug for two minutes is immediately a ‚Äúgay movie‚Äù like, that‚Äôs the genre
===
This is all to say, if all you want is ‚Äúmunky punch lizurd‚Äù and you got that, great! If you were expecting more and were disappointed, also great! But it‚Äôs one movie. Can we please stop making it about the entire goddamn genre? Thanks.
===
@BrianG1227 @edenjoking @CBMShampoo @DiamondSpiderP I think there's levels. "Comic book" doesn't, nor should it, mean one thing. A Spider-Man book by Brian Bendis isn't gonna have the same tone as Jeph Loeb Batman or Ed Brubaker Captain America. The idea that a movie has to be goofy or camp to be a CBM does the whole genre dirty.
===
I unfollowed Whit Stillman on Twitter tonight because he was defending Woody Allen. Can anyone recommend a new director to me that‚Äôs entire filmography is in the genre of ‚ÄúWhite People Talking‚Äù?

===
@PolitiksCommon @ComicBook She's barely been working as a director. She only had one hit, a low-budget indie in a totally different genre. There is zero in her resume to suggest she's qualified to direct a sci-fi/fantasy epic like New Gods. And WB does not have a producer like Kevin Feige to save the film.
===
@Neb153 Who's sad? Let's please keep a totally unqualified director with no track record of success in genre films, who lost $131 million on her first big-budget film, out of the DCEU. She would kill New Gods as badly as DC killed Green Lantern with the Reynolds film.
===
@PanicJrCress Yeah,

#TodayInHistory 
1968 - Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey receives its world premiere. Upon release, the epic about human evolution, technology, and extraterrestrial life polarized audiences and critics alike. Today, it is considered a classic in its genre.

@Trad_West_Art I felt it. It wasn't super original and the Batman lore was shoe-horned in there. But I found the performance, the violence and desperate nihilism sadly compelling.

@HopeJustice1938 "either"? Oh no, WB was dumb enough to ask King to write the movie Ava was directing.

To answer your question, NO ONE. I have no idea what WB was thinking. King's appeal is far too narrow and DuVernay has proven that fantasy is not her genre.
===
Watched the new Godzilla VS Kong movie in the theater and my suspicions were correct- I will cry during any movie regardless of the genre ayyyyyyyyyye
===
Oftentimes people will get snobby and say that a director is too good for the genre. Which is absurd. It's okay if a genre isn't your thing. For example, I don't like westerns. But you wouldn't say someone is "too good" for one.
===
@KatInTheCLE Netflix? If so, try the series Who killed Sarah or a European trilogy based on the Batzan Trilogy of books. First movie is the invisible guardian. It is crime drama. I love the movie Kiss the girls, not that good, but in that genre.
