front of you on the table.   There are four of each type of card located around the island.  Once a card is removed, the coloured space is treated as just a normal space and other players must aim for the remaining cards.

A fantastic brand new board game for ALL age...

@MikeDrucker We are in!!!

Top tip:
Midway through the game made sure to move the whole board &amp; associated pieces/cards to another room to free up the table you were playing (so you can eat a meal or something).

Then move it back later.

Don’t forget to get a few cards mixed up/pieces lost.

@KousenZephyr There is a Table Top Game Simulator on Steam, and the community is adding more and more support for board games on this.

@WalkerBragman @ACleverNickname Well we are far past the ‘game over’ threshold for the ‘pandemic’ table top game that was out for years before covid. the board game is over when there are too many outbreaks in too many countries, and in real life were well into multiple mutations

Got my copy of Bullet by @Level99Games so hyped to dive in. If you haven't played, try it on table top sim. It's a bullet hell board game that you don't think will work but 100% does https://t.co/u2zaLX8tuZ

@lukeisamazing There is a board game with dice dating back to three thousand years before Christ. The same human problems that we meet today they met back then - food on table, where to live, family and what to do in your spare time.

@nicklockwood Yah.  Might take a team effort - mom distracts two and you work with third.

How old?

If stagecast is still around it’s was good starting point for Geek.  No typing.  100% visual.  Quite creative (spun out of Apple’s old ATG, IIRC). 

Also, board / card game making is fun :)

Who’s excited? I’m excited!!! Streaming the stardew valley board game right now! Cannot wait to see how this wonderful video games translates to table top. See you soon.

One of my dreams is to own a poker table, mainly so it can double as a board game table.

Good food, good games, good people. That’s my dream. https://t.co/puSQhsmM8C

All it really needs is 'Each citizen to receive a commemorative caramel square'.

Each school to receive a tree ? I guess they can put it alongside that 'The Top Table' board game The Nolan Show sent them a couple of years back <U+0001F644> https://t.co/aifehC6z3I

@tha_rami I've been hesitant because I have a design problem specifically for a table top board game. I'm unsure if you have experience with that realm of game design (I wouldn't be surprised if you did have experience! <U+0001F601>), I just don't want to waste your time or take up a slot <U+0001F642>

@GailSimone are you familiar with the YouTube board game show called Table Top starring Will Wheaton? Seven seasons of fantastic table top gaming. I highly recommend it
