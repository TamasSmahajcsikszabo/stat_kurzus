@eamonlynch Big fine for her but would be pocket change for those at the top of the game. Penalty strokes are the only fair and effective sanction across the board. Requires strong officials who are prepared to do their job, not just single out the easy targets as they have done in the past.

big issue there, tho, was just *very* low replayability. you maybe get three sessions with the same party, and tbh it isn't something you can share with new people as easily after that (fog of love, a rly good board game, comes to mind as comparable paired down and finite).

@SAKtap24 Obviously the pressure is next level at that point. But if Brooks would‚Äôve came down with the board, taken one power dribble, and went straight back up then I think he scores. Maybe gets fouled. But yea 0/8 to end the game is tough to swallow.

Scoring went back and forth a little, and with the board showing 47-36 UK, Calipari gave freshman Charlton Clarke @clarkekent3 a rest.  But an unlikely sub came in: Giddel Padilla.  Calipari wanted to save Travieso and his four fouls for later in the game.

I didn‚Äôt care *that much* about the final result because Michigan had no hope against Gonzaga anyway, but this team was so good and so fun all season that I really wish they‚Äôd played better in their last game. Shame that they were dreadful just about across the board in this one.

@NewWaveOil Chasing the whole game after a bad start. Rinse. Repeat. Tippett panicked after Toronto games at home and loaded the top line. Much easier to match against on the road. Back to the drawing board.

That is, B changed the rules of the game before A could even set up their defenses (i.e., B started his attack on the chess board by changing how each piece *could* be played, while A was playing by rules A believed were agreed upon).

This is how B will win the game.

lmfao i‚Äôm never gonna see Randle on my board again huh it‚Äôs all 1k mt. game fucking sucks.

@cyansorcery I'm going to make a game town that's just a CPS2 Board and nobody can stop me

@SavaniaGames @AtikinGames @ddaviddx2 So the game comes with pawns in every one of the Board Game Survival Kit colors. And a set of tiny miniature pawns. And a little bitty plastic baggie that looks empty, but I have faith that an even smaller set of pawns is in there. And look, is that another baggie inside?

This and PE2 really deserve remakes. Seeing how well FF7R did, I can't imagine it would be hard to convince investors to get on board with this. Modern tech could make this a really amazing game. https://t.co/IpseRy1Jvy

Stoked to welcome @SteelersWireAK to The Game Day family! Allison provided killer content at the XFL and crushes it out of the gate here.

If you're looking for a new #NFL follow, hop on board with AK as we head into the #NFLDraft. https://t.co/UHet9yuR7N

@HoodieKyrie11_ @dekbball1 @pash961 @kirkgoldsberry @KyrieIrving Curry has better numbers per game, per 36min, per 100 poss, and total, across the board outside of blocks and turnovers

I love Kyrie but stop it, he's not /better/ (and he's a trash Point Guard but a great Shooting Guard)

@emmackenz Fair. Coding should be conceptualized first. Robot Turtles is an excellent board game for it. However she said WHEN NOT AVAILABLE seemingly without an idea it would be her fault if it wasn‚Äôt available... and so only private rich kids get the tech? There‚Äôs so much to unpack.

2. Hub Quests are your bread &amp; butter for gaining HR. MH is a multiplayer game at its core and it‚Äôs the most fun way to play.

@JudeT5green @Brewers The scoreboard was messed up to. The board was still tallying stats for Hader in the 8th when Williams pitching. It also showed Garc√≠a batting when Vogelbach was hitting and Shaw at 3rd after Peterson entered the game.

@sullymantra Sorry! yeah I agree!!! I mean relative to other GW products it's priced at about what I would expect, for board game enjoyers its pretty steep

@dumbledore221b @AnimatedScp Thanks for your question!
There's no online version of the game, only the physical one. But if you enjoyed watching us play then I recommend getting the physical board game! The cards are beautifully illustrated and it makes for a great game night with friends! :]

@goodtimesociety Also, as a kid I totally tried to design a board game for Homer's The Odyssey. I'd love to see that too. No idea who I'd give that project to though.

@rb5kcid That means a lot to hear but it's still frustrating and scary, you know?

Like...you're a safe space on the Minesweeper board and that's important, but being queer and trying to get Healthcare shouldn't be Minesweeper game in the first place

This is going to be great for the game. I mean, I was already on board when they gave FL4K a Scooter hat, but this is dope. https://t.co/HcpiSiMjqb

Major League Baseball is currently scheduled to hold its All-Star game in Atlanta this summer.  Unless Georgia reverses these laws, MLB should move the game
