Where is #RangDe US Collections report??? 

Paid agents like @THEPANIPURI we're trying to buildup..
===
#RangDe Routine Rotta.. 

Looks like Producers have paid all these @THEPANIPURI Bhel Puri type of Reviewers.. 

At least #Aranya offers you something different.. 

My Recommendation would be #GodzillaVsKong .... It's Epic...
===
#RangDe is Super Flop in US.. 

Premiers is not even $50K &amp; this @THEPANIPURI guy was comparing it with Blockbuster #JathiRatnalu ..

Tenjyou Tenge will be having a photoshoot, so I won't put on sunscreen!

I believe that there are rabbits in the moon.
===
The rainy season already arrived. Having a walk in a rainy day wouldn't be that bad
===
The wind is so strong that it pierced my body. Managing one's body condition is much more important that works, okay?
===
Half a year already passed. It feels like time flies by when I'm with you
===
This year I've relied on you a lot too. As the new year unwraps I hope to work well with you again.
===
Should I teach you the trick on how to properly lie to Tsubaki?
===
Tatsumi was looking at the Koinobori's with such a happy expression. I wonder what he was thinking about
===
The voice of a bell cricket is truly beautiful. It healed me.
===
Well then, I'm going to get sweets from Tsubaki and the others ♪
===
When I was a kid I used to make Kamakura with Tsubaki a lot.
===
From which story should we start?
===
I-Chu!
===
My heart feels renewed when I change my room design. How about you?
===
Please wait patiently and have some tea.
===
It turned into the season of strawberries♪

Fufu~ there's no one else who suits the image of Autumn Appetite as much as Ban-kun!

@pandemo32963455 @trackntracer @robertburke84 Personally I would be more concerned about getting a psa check or cervical check cos guess what.....
You can survive sars2 cancer kills.
How many people with cancer are you going to track and trace.
