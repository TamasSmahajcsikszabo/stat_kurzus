I loaded up the #pressurepot today 😂 Should be able to demold everything around 2pm tomorrow. Poked a piece or two so may be some collateral damage 😬

And I get to see how badly I mucked up the foil on the #dicetower (dark resin is not see through!) 😅🤷‍♀️ https://t.co/N7YeTIXRiY

We played 'The Dibia' again today and first time for @TobetheNerd, @AAdekaiyaoja(Afolabi) and Chuks.

I love the feedback and game balance so far 😊 and we played with our #DiceTower 😃

How many times do you playtest?

Dice Towers are often made of wood, and as brilliant as they are, they rarely have an aesthetically pleasing design like this 😍 @Gamegenic are highly recommended by Ninja Mitton for good reason! #gamegenic #dicetower #comingsoon #dice #tabletop #games #roleplaygames #ninjamitton https://t.co/e6j7E1YDpl
