@Rai_Galilei Guess there's a caveat for this.

If you expect a 1:1 representation or something like a D&amp;D, then you might as well play D&amp;D. Most of "vidya turned board game" cuts a lot of stuff to make it fit.

Replacing things with dice or cards or phone apps.

@108 In the unlikely event that you‚Äôre filming at the College Mall in Bloomington tomorrow, stop by the board game store at the mall and I‚Äôll give you a free copy of the Doom board game. You can even shoot some B-roll in the store while you‚Äôre there.

Don‚Äôt be logical with democrats. It‚Äôs like playing chess with a pigeon. 

You‚Äôre winning until the pigeon turns the board over and shits on everything in a victory display.

Improving your chess skills won't help you win next time.

The pigeon isn't playing the same game.

@austonwithano @108 Is the Doom board game any good??? My only experience with video game board game adaptations are Dark Souls and Bloodborne. Dope minis. Pretty OK gameplay.

If you love X-Men and Board Games and want a game absolutely stacked with over 100 mutants, you have 90 minutes left to pledge for Marvel United: X-Men on Kickstarter.

@greenmonk I still have doubts the theme is going to shine through enough for me, but the amount of plastic it supplies for me to homebrew my own X-game makes it worth it.

And, yeah... they hit Board Game communities hard, but didn't promote to comic fans nearly enough. Coulda done &gt;10M.

@RorySmith @PhilBlundell @Donalmca @Chrisdalgaard01 Standard of competitive football across the board has been poor. VAR hasn't helped imo (slightly biased as I despise it) but I've not watched a PL game since December after watching a triple header where the standard was barely pub level. Players were clearly visibly knackered

@DownTheAlleyPod @austinpmac17 Jeez.  So much to unpack here.  I won't say scumbag, but has to be something BIG.  You're in a playoff 1 goal game and the FOGO scores and you can take it off the board if his stick is illegal?  Play to win the game.  

This is a non league JV game?  Knock it off and move on.

@salehczk One of my favorite places in the world is La Revanche in Quebec City. It's a board game bar and they have kind of game concierges who will come to your table, ask you what games you've enjoyed, and make recommendations based on those.

@salehczk This makes me sound like a jerk, but I just mean that I have a sort of brain that very quickly gets into a game and very quickly gets out of it, which makes me an irritating board game friend if we're not playing cooperatively.

@JohnrussIII @Bmar28 @JoeGoodberry @NewStripeCity I don't think it had anything to do with Sewell. I think the game is changing rapidly and the weapons on the board were too good to pass up.

@Cre8Liberty Maybe sometimes, but when Donnely, for ex, voted against confirming Kav, he lost his seat in Indiana. I give dems a fair amount of lee-way to "play the game", because at the national level, it often matters more, alas, to keep the board more blue than red overall.

#ttrpg thought.

In card games and board games, the rulebook rarely explains how to play. What I mean is that, while rules are surely explained, being actually good at the game is left to the player, exception made for few minor tips at best.

1/4
===
@glauer42 Well, it is actually recommended, when explaining board games, not to suggest how to achieve victory. Usually you should simply provide the rules and leave up to the players to understand how to win the game through them. I played a lot of MtG and it is the same.

@rabidsooner That my friend is called a Wahoo board.  It's similar to the game Sorry.

@SpectrumNews1OH Has anyone ever noticed the board game Monopoly is only made by one company?

The transfer window opens on June 9, so of course we‚Äôll have Twitter peeps coming out the day after our last game or even first week of the window saying ‚Äúsack the board we‚Äôve not signed anyone‚Äù, or replying to Chelsea saying ‚Äúsign someone‚Äù or ‚ÄúAnnounce XYZ‚Äù.

@kinzer_sarah @TangoTekLP designing a game off of an existing board game &amp; currently translating/ rebuilding Among Us in survival Minecraft has honestly carried me through the past 1¬Ω years of struggle with my brain disease as I need to distract myself a lot from my trauma memories &amp; symptoms.

@SaintGarlic @RezekJoe Tenzi is a dice game where you have to be the fastest player to roll all 10 of your dice to the same number. There are variations e.g. I like the one where you have to roll 1 one, 2 twos etc.https://t.co/DGtGwqWHmP

They made us ANOTHER AWESOME video, showing that this game is fun for families with younger kids too!

@Timcast And yet somehow when you talk to most Dems they think that it's only the Republicans. News flash they all do it. Dems just to the game late under Clinton but it is working out because it's most of the tech giants they got on board with.

@GailSimone https://t.co/nT6A3D3FOn

I enjoyed it. :)

@rabidsooner It‚Äôs a wahoo board! Very fun game!

@AttackRoomba @ScrewyClassic @ZhugeEX @IGN I actually wouldn't mind playing thru the whole game with a balance board.

@vidityavoleti Krosmasters arena has literally my fav board game instructions because of this. There are maps directly in the rulebook you plsy on to learn the rules.

You are playing chess with a pigeon. 

You are winning until the pigeon turns the board over and starts shitting on everything in a victory display.

Improving your chess skills won't help you win next time or clean up the shitty pieces.

The pigeon isn't playing the same game.
===
Remind me, friends, who among you does intense, fiddly board/war game tech edits? 
I have a contact looking for somebody who is equipped to dig in deep to something with lots of moving pieces, and it definitely needs a tech editor style, not a copy editor style.

Tonight my 5year old grabbed my @BBCBargainHunt jacket and the board game and played his own version! He loves the show and is desperate to be on it ‚Äúwhen grows up‚Äù and be on #teamred just like his Mumma and his nana @JackieSims_1416 ‚ù§Ô∏èüíô https://t.co/BJjZkTxsiu

@GailSimone Red Dragon Inn expansion! My favorite board game,tbh - Even better as drinking game.

@cjcapalot_ Its a board puzzle game with passives and buddy skills and stuff its not really like candy crush at all. I can see how visually it looks that way though.
===
Returnal has some handy debug cheat codes if you connect a keyboard: Returnal, as you won't need telling if you've been braving its trials this week, isn't an easy game.

@NeddyTucks @KJohnstonmicdup @samanthacp_ @Avry Knuckle-draggers can moan about the changing game all you want; write about it with your quill pen using a lantern and listening to your 8-track tapes.

5.4 MILLION raised for the X-Men United board game that‚Äôs just bananas. What I love about it though is the more people back it, the more value we get from backing it. I‚Äôm gonna need to reup my painting supplies.

@Moon_DoggieXIII these days? when the name of the game is to either make the unbreakable board or break the unbreakable board? Nah, if Pendulum Magicians can still have six negates, Cyber Dragons can have two.

@Savion Brand was big in the UK comedy scene before Hollywood.. Like a raunchier &amp; sexier Ricky Gervais(?) w/ rockstar rep. Not like his dad was chairman of NY FED/on board of Goldman Sachs like David Benioff (of Game of Thrones fame/infamy). So much of HWood is BS connections like that

@LegoBrickbaron I'd buy this board game.

@GailSimone Horrified, the Universal Monsters board game. A lot of fun and great for people new to more rules-heavy board games.

I was wondering why the Nevsky board game uses "provender" instead of "provisions" and it turns out that medieval baggage trains are like, mostly food for horses. Horses need ten times the food your soldiers do in terms of tonnage! https://t.co/TzyJZjB2PW

Gonna try a player prop that I think is too easy to jump on.

Tom Wilson Under 0.5 points

Reasoning should be pretty obvious. Gonna be leveled or in the box all night. He's pretty 50/50 with getting on the board against the #NYR but managed 2 points despite his 16 PIM last game.

@BerkeleyEverett I have a ‚Äúlife size‚Äù place value chart that runs the entire wall of my classroom. I have students ‚Äúwalk‚Äù the chart to model multiplication by multiples of 10. For 100x100, they begin in front of 100 and walk ‚Äúup‚Äù two place values, modeling 10x10. It‚Äôs like a big game board.

@Devy_Kane @BobGilchristFF I‚Äôm extrapolating that that is feeling that many dynasty managers are going to be on board with.  I don‚Äôt care about players or their production.
