@commaficionado But then, both dad and I are ND, and not massive fans of wearing masks, so we didn‚Äôt force her to comply.

@ashleighdiane86 NO - do not take Tylenol until several hours after any Covid shot.

Read the CDC data.  Tylenol can lie the vaccine response if taken before vaccination.

He is thankful that he is wearing a mask to cover his reddening cheeks.

The bookstore trip is a success and Gray is impressed because Jas knows how to subtly cover him from the crowd. Jas uses his body to cover Gray, and he does it smoothly. No one even notices.
