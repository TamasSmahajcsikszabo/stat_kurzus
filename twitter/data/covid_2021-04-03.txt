@Angela68060318 @heylinM @neslihan_yeldan Covid-19 is a nove virus so for the vaccine to work they need to give you a novel virus that your immue system hasnt met before. Viral vector method is how most vaccines have work for years? Conpared to mRNA of course it is traditional.

Current covid vaccines need 2 weeks AFTER the full dose course (2 doses for the ones we have) to give us a good amount of antibodies.

The military coup is worse than the pandemic in #Myanmar. Within first 60 days of COVID-19 pandemic, 6 were dead but 573 civilians are dead within 60 days of military coup. Junta will keep on murdering the civilians unless we end the coup.

The worldwide response to #COVID19 has demonstrated the power of solidarity. People are spreading kindness through their words &amp; deeds -- while inspiring others to do the same.

@ToniaBuxton @naomirwolf Hi Tonia and Naomi 

Would love to hear your thoughts on what‚Äôs happening in Brazil 

From your tweets, you‚Äôre probably delighted there‚Äôs no quarantine, mask mandated or social distancing 

But their healthcare system is collapsed &amp; ICU wards have no spare beds

@ant_iuculano @Nick_Romeo_ @zg_raves @jvedmond @emmeyekayeee @_facts_matter @spiritnght2 No. The mask is a precautionary measure. For the most part, You, a vaccinated individual, will fight off the Virus before you can spread it. In the event your body can‚Äôt Fight off the Virus, the mask acts as a safety net.

@TheLifeDramatic @paulwaugh @UKLabour I definitely think the timing of these elections during a surge of support for the Tories with vaccine rollout will distort things - it's inevitable. Gov support will go down after all this and when the focus has shifted from Covid.

99.9% chance of survival from Covid. Why bother with a vaccine that has untested short, medium and long-term affects? Why be a lemming? I fear for many of you and who you will blame when your health may be compromised by this rush to a badly vetted vaccine https://t.co/cvXQA0TSBB

I guess every people should take a lesson from maharastra covid spread
- wear #mask
