===
I was wrong. It’s a week &amp; a half away. For some reason that makes me more anxious. Why am I anxious about it? I think it’s just the sociable aspect of it. I’m really out of practice &amp; need to start getting used to it again.

Literally woke up to one of the worst messages ever, and I've spent this morning crying. My anxiety gets the best of me sometimes. Situations make me so anxious that I want to fix them right away.

Explaining to someone, crying, how much something hurt you and asking them not to do it again, and then seeing how it goes and doing it again, is one of the most painful, sad and disappointing things in the world. I do not wish it to anyone.

I hate this. Having depression out of nowhere really puts me down, like I was streaming earlier, I felt lonely and I been talking to myself to keep the stream going but I had to stop for tonight so you guys don't see me cry and I deleted the vods because I looks depressing.

@MuniSunrise So sad 😔
Ok but i get so annoyed like,,,, the "i love you" scenes in Ss are def somewhat ship tease but theyre mainly intimate moments between friends who make 100% sense yet somehow its bait because its not like friends can say i love you to each other 🙄
===
There's so much going on in my head today. I was trying to enjoy my time gaming with friends but I felt like I keep bring the mood down . I wish I could've just enjoyed gaming with them and didnt have this fucking anxiety.

“...Yet if you should forget me for a while and afterwards remember, do not grieve: 
for if the darkness and corruption leave 
a vestige of the thoughts that once I had, better by far you should forget and smile 
than that you should remember and be sad.”

-Christina Rossetti https://t.co/ri2SB5phV5

@MobilePunch For a high ranking government official as the AGF to speak like this shows how sad Nigerian leaders are. Does the spare part trade cause harm to people's livelihood or death to their landlords and neighbors. Is it not more organized that indiscriminate grazing?

Symptoms of porn addiction involve an inability to stop use by oneself, use in public spaces with fear, shame or danger. It is usually comorbid with alcohol, depression and anxiety. For treatment see a professional quickly because it is highly debilitating.

The world is mourning the loss of Kentaro Miura, and I am sad too...😢😢
Berserk was a unique and wonderful work of art, and I can't believe it's going to end unfinished...
I'm sure Miura-sensei is most disappointed. I pray for his soul.

Bro, this really makes me sad. Berserk was one of the very first manga's I had ever read. It's makes me sad to know that the world he made, and the word I loved reading about will never be given the proper ending it truly deserves. Rip https://t.co/TwNOAhduw9

#OTD super cyclone Amphan made landfall on the Bengal coast, unleashing unforeseen terror. By the time it weakened and turned into a depression, 98 lives were lost in India - mainly in WB - &amp; another 26 in B'desh. This image from NatGeo remains my lasting https://t.co/gWi7LRry2s

It is kinda hard for me to feel sad about the death of someone I never knew personally and had respect for only due to the appreciation of his work.
Does this make sense?
I think it does. 
Because I really admire Miura to have so many people in this community mourn his passing.

Self comparison in ministry is the shortest route to depression, marital problems and suicide. Don’t borrow money you don’t have to project your ministry in a particular manner or to live a lifestyle you can’t afford just because of what you see other men of God doing. https://t.co/TIHOrStXvK

When I was younger I always would sleep in until the last minute before college. Then when It came to starting work, if I ate before a shift my body would purposefully throw it up if I had something in my stomach due to anxiety of being in an environment

@RepTimRyan Sad thing is .. many Rs who voted against the Commission know their colleague Ryan is correct. The

@SamsonKasumba You have really [willingly or unwillingly] at that, traded your conscience for a profit on the street. It's so sad. Isn't it? The Prophet Mohammed said of Khalid Ibn Walid when the latter was defending idolatry that "surely, a wise man like him ought to know right from wrong".🤔
