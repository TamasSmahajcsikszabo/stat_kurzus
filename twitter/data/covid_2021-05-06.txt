HOWEVER.

The vaccine's efficacy plummets without the 2nd dose.

The study found just 58% protection vs #Covid19 infection 7-14 days after 1st dose

===
@okmesaurav @GoogleIndia yes there is...as virus mutation made it airborne and active in air for hours it's better to keep the mask tight with second layer..

due to gap created by single mask near nose or sides of cheeks or below chin may not block the virus and chances of getting infection higher.
