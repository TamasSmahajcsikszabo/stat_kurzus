Can we have a huge roll of paper with two lists sat side by side outside of parliament? One list is women killed within this country at the hands of a man and the second list is every single citizen who have died of Covid-19

I'm about to go on a 2 hour online webinar about Long-Covid with South Derbyshire CVS. I'm doing it as part of my voluntary role within the ME/CFS/Fibro support group I'm part of. 2 hours is going to be a killer. #LongCovidKids #MECFS #pwME #MyalgicEncephalomyelitis

@libertytarian No, I’m not suspicious. Because preventing an illness is more cost-effective and less of a drain on hospital staff and resources than treating an illness, which is still not a guaranteed cure. No one vaccinated has been hospitalized or died from COVID.

Mr. Baber is in for a hell of a shock at the next election, when he realizes it was the PC brand, money, volunteers, and campaign apparatus - and nothing to do with him - that got him into office in the first place.

I call it "Rathgeber Syndrome"

Government have no idea how to get the vaccine to the general public. Instead they vaccinate those in the confines of HSE property. Should be pretty obvious that’s what they’ve done to max the rollout. https://t.co/C4OhK2rOym
