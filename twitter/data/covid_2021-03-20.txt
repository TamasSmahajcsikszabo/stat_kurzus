@UKCopHumour My physco Dog pulls me into the bloody pet shop whenever we pass. 

Shouldn't have got into a habit of walking by and buying treats.  

Now every time we walk him past. It's like an exocet missile straight into the shop.

They allow dog's to enter.  And he doesn't need a mask <U+0001F601>

Very pertinent Q&amp;As regarding COVID-19 vaccination. 
Nutshell is that vaccine has been produced and marketed in a hurry without extensive field testing. Thus its results will be known after tracing people vaccinated.

@himantabiswa Again there are circulars regarding wearing of mask and not doing so will attract a Rs. 1000 fine. That is ridiculous, 1000 Rupees is not a small amount, for many people it is an earning for a whole week, how is a person going to pay that, this is not fair.
===
@himantabiswa Wearing a mask is a good thing, advising citizens to do so is also a good thing but collecting 1000 Rs for not wearing it is wrong, many people do not even have that much money in their pockets.

@Baroness_Nichol Can’t speak for Germany, but in Norway they’ve paused the AZ vaccine until they see whether more problems emerge. Although COVID is rising, deaths remain very low at present and hopefully the rollout will only be marginally delayed. It’s a more cautious approach all round.

my jaw is too big for this mask

@SarkySage The mask inconsistencies are stupid. One week all post and food delivery drivers are wearing one and I can breathe a sigh of relief. The next week no one is wearing any. A handful of people wearing them in the streets and shops are hit-and-miss with social distancing and masks.<U+0001F612>

At this point I’m looking back at my life &amp; asking what else have they lied about?

@AidenActually Face masks are a normal part of life in most Asian countries. If a person thinks they may have a flu or cold they wear a mask to not spread their germs, it's a communitarian impulse. Also immune compromised ppl wear them to protect themselves.
