The movie "The Karate Kid"

In typical movie making or storytelling, especially when starting in a franchise, you need to accept that not everyone in the theater, house, or wherever you watch your movies, is a fan of the franchise or genre your film is based on. They are there not for the fan service...

#TheFalconAndTheWinterSoldier ends today ---- here's my essay on how the Disney+ series engaged with the tropes of its genre: the 'Buddy Cop' movie. For @firstpost 

I really, really love comics and comicbook films and writing this took my mind off things for a bit. https://t.co/dCCyFcJsn4

It sucks that if MORTAL KOMBAT isn't successful the cast is likely going to tagged with that when they maybe New Line Cinema shouldn't have hired a first-time director for a video game adaptation when the genre is known for rushed/cheap feature films.
===
Sometimes things that seem very trivial are most difficult to execute. For example, comedy is the most difficult genre for an actor, and erotica is the most difficult genre for a writer.
===
‚ÄúIn our conversations, the director often mentioned the elements of the film noir and I liked the concept of telling a contemporary story through the means of the old-time genre.‚Äù Ieva Marija Baranauskaitƒó. https://t.co/ACQdG8ysBZ

#ThePriest antha bekaar movie chudale in this genre. There wasn‚Äôt any suspense at all, and literally a new born kid can see all the twists from a mile away. And the ‚Äúscares‚Äù were LoL-able. 150 minutes is quite a stretch that compounds our misery with ultimate boredom. Skip

@SurAuvers @SoulPatchanBuff @AD_Strider It does work,  because ghostbusters 2016 was NOT made for the fans of the originals, the director was explicit about that.

@Zhane_Star I want to say Mars Attacks, but that's too easy and I grew up on that.

That's okay though because Where The Dead Go to Die exists, and it also used the Comedy genre as a front to lower my guard to the movie's true nature. Easily pried open my childhood scars from Mars Attacks.

@killerwolffilms i just had never seen a movie switch from one genre to the other like that

threw my mind at the time
===
The movie is called

Apoopcalypse: Journey into to the Sewers of Doom.

What genre and plot do you give it?

Go!
===
You know what movie still hasn't gotten enough credit? Troll Hunter. It somehow manages to take an idea that you'd think would be absurd, and it turns that basic idea into a movie that's gripping, scary, funny, and at times, moving. It also revitalizes the fake documentary genre.

@ilovejohnkimble The movie created a genre.

I highly recommend it. He gives Sam Rockwell style dance. It has all the elements of a fantastic movie of this genre. If he doesn't win an award for this movie I will be astonished.
===
Dumb as rocks and violent AF is my favorite movie genre
===
so I've brought it up enough times doing a solo thread on it, Berberian Sound Studio (2012) by Peter Strickland (In Fabric) is to my mind one of if not the BEST example of how to critique and deconstruct an era/genre in cinema https://t.co/JOkvQdD7uR
===
like I said it feels like the movie exists to try and argue rape revenge movies are bad and shouldn't exist, it's an argument against the genre it's in, all of which just feels like a lot of effort for a really empty goal
===
@sweetiegoemon ...but it didn't ALSO feel the need to BE a '70s Italian horror movie, like by dressing itself in the trappings of a rape revenge film but cutting out the violence it actually makes its critique that the violent catharsis of the genre is an inherently male appeal of the fantasy
===
It feels emblematic of how a certain vocal subset of audiences approaches deconstruction and cinema overall these days? Like this isn't like say Knives Out, a deconstruction of parlor mystery to explore why we like them, it's a DECONSTRUCTION in that it wants to shame the genre
===
If you watched Courage the Cowardly Dog, Goosebumps, Beetlejuice, Scooby Doo, etc. as a kid, your favorite movie genre is probably horror üëª

@lvstfulskies @buckysrose Snowblower is very violent, gory and intense. You have to like that kind of genre to like it.

@BatKilmer @theSNYDERVERSE That they knew they didn't want to proceed with it.

But the sequels sounded awful, would only oversaturate the genre, and did not need to happen

@mistydawnfilm Yes! We did a last dragon episode with @danielleradford but that just means you‚Äôd pick a horror and we‚Äôd match it with a martial arts movie you haven‚Äôt seen before! We love folks new to either genre because they go together so well.

@biomechanicaI netflix's fault because they promoted the movie as a fun genre film with cool lesbians in it like idk Bound or Debs (which are a lot of fun) rather than a pretty dark movie because they wanted a bigger audience for it. just giving a warning because that's still not being said
===
@biomechanicaI A lot of my friends really liked it and felt deeply affected by it but from what I have heard huge trigger warnings for it. It's not a fun/cathartic genre movie like netflix promoted it as. It seems to be a deeply miserable vague and slow movie that's also really good.

@Eon_Reel @JackValentino10 @certainvids Do you even know what a movie genre means? You are aware you can have a cbm that's horror right? Action? Romance? You are aware cbm and drama aren't the same categories? Seriously man maybe google your definitions first before using them poorly.
===
@Eon_Reel @JackValentino10 @certainvids Yes because you're making a movie about a comic book character. If you take it in different directions but it's still about this character and their decent into madness, all that's changed is your story is a character study, that doesn't mean it's a different genre now.

@titMcGrit2 Maybe. But it‚Äôs engrossing and well-acted/made. A good example of a genre thriller where - much like a cool action movie - it‚Äôs the journey, not the destination. If everything else works, it doesn‚Äôt matter if the outcome or overal execution isn‚Äôt highly unique.

@Zypher Paranoia Agent! my personal fave

Genre is psychological thriller. The director once mentioned that the intended way to watch it is by watching it in regular order, and then to rewatch it in reverse order https://t.co/x60nJbWxgK

@dianamhs70 @FiercePenelope Thanks! What types of movies do you like? I‚Äôm a huge comedy fan but like just about any genre except horror. Old Boy (or maybe it‚Äôs Ol Boy) is a Korean classic. It‚Äôs a very intense movie about vengeance after a man is locked in a room for 20+ years.

I've reached the episode of War of the Worlds that's set around the anniversary of the Orson Wells broadcast, here repurposed as government propaganda to hide an initial alien excursion prior to the 1953 movie. Frankly I find it damn clever &amp; way ahead of 1988 genre TV concepts.

@TheFancyDandy @Just_ATR @IGN It's like if the writers of every 80's action movie were on LSD when writing them. I highly recommend it, but it's also not for everyone.

@HurricaneJaimee Hmmm tough to tell. It‚Äôs not like, gory or anything. It‚Äôs not even a horror movie, I‚Äôd call it a dark comedy if I had to give it a genre. It has to be seen to be believed.

@crewless The film stars the great Reece Shearsmith, who does a genre anthology series in the UK called Inside No 9. This was in a similar vein but made mostly outdoors in the woods. 

Also, thr movie was a great theatrical experience.

@authorESsmith @KennieJD That was always the point of the videos, to do makeup WHILE doing [thing]. It's a popular genre in the beauty community. The focus is on both and merging interest niches, not just offering a makeup review or a movie review.

@pup_hime @benjanun_s It's going to be yet another CGI superhero movie but with a surface gloss of a martial arts film. It's going to be sub-Kill Bill-level pastiche because at least Tarantino knows enough about the genre to hire Yuen Wu Ping to come and recycle old choreography into a western film.

@TheDevil0fHK it‚Äôs not super obvious if you‚Äôre familiar with the genre, cause the most famous actor is always the killer, and unless you could see who was using iphones in the film, you might doubt it was him and think it might be someone else. but that being said yeah. still cinema.

if knives out had left the mystery genre and stayed a thriller, I don't think it would have been satisfying

the beginning of the movie sets up a detective story‚Äîa twist into another genre isn't enough payoff for all that setup

as an ending to the individual story, I thought it worked pretty well. it fit the tone of the rest of the movie

but because of the genre expectations left un-satisfied, as a viewer I was also a little un-satisfied
