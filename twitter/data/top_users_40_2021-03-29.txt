@houserulescafe 100%

I think any experienced game cafe will tell you - stock the mass market classics, people ask for them.
===
@AlmostKirk @_Toukana It's such a "shareable" game, right? No matter how you score - you end up with something that's a joy to look at and you feel like "I wanna show this off!!!"
===
It's ok for people to not like board games.

They can just not like them for whatever reason and we, as board game fans, can just go "that's cool - want to watch a movie instead?"
===
@TwitchFactory how long of a game is it? i'd be open to trying it out!
===
@TheKitastrophe I swear I only want the vaccine so that I can go to conventions so that I can punch you in the shoulder.
===
@_RavenMckenzie @AlmostKirk Yay! What a lovely land and nice score!
===
@AtomicRobot76 @_Toukana Tell me how it goes! I hope you have fun!
===
@seanwest @boardgamerpinup I'm so glad you're enjoying it! But yeah - definitely is hard to put down. I'm almost glad it's not on a mobile platform right now cuz I'd probably be playing TOO  much.
===
@boardgamerpinup Try it now! It’s the kind of game you just dip in and out of when you’re in the mood. So if you try it now, then you’ll know how to play and can explore it at your leisure. It’s totally chill.
===
@AsmadiGames @_Toukana Boop. 🧡 https://t.co/SuKBgcOf4U
===
I got worse! But I don't even care. Look at that river network I had going! #DorfRomantik @_Toukana https://t.co/rrRkFJLwcN
===
This is some 5 flame hex flex, Marshall. Brutal. https://t.co/CV9kkXmnaa
===
@Cephalofair @_Toukana Super glad you're enjoying it. I appreciate that you didn't show your high score that decimates mine. 😂
===
@BrothersMurph @_Toukana LOL yeah. Someone mentioned "perfect matching sides" in a reply and I was like "ohhhhhhhh yeah. i should try for that."
===
@atlasgames It ended up being a super close score and she liked it. Was great to see how scores balanced out between things like dice runs vs compounded hazards.
===
Yes, I think there's a board game for everyone. But hell if I think forcing it on someone will help them find it.
===
This is how this dang game gets me...

See - I should NOT place this tile here. There's another rail line that would help it score later and I kill that chance putting it here. 

BUT.

This little line NEEDS a choo choo and this choo choo fits so perfectly! 🚂 https://t.co/s7Q4CEuzyu https://t.co/qtidArc3AC
===
Why am I getting worse at this game?! 😭😭😭
#DorfRomantik 

(But I am proud of the little rail loop and the river looping.) https://t.co/xWlSgvoJUu
===
@RabidCadaver @_Toukana It's funny how the land can evolve depending on what you're optimizing for. I think it's a very pretty octopus land. 😉
===
@tiffanyleigh that makes me sad. i really like the team at grail games and they don't deserve that kind of crap.
===
Mining dice in #DiceMiner from @atlasgames. My 12yo is learning the pain of being forced to take a die to reveal one for me. Muhahahaha!!! https://t.co/u4dQ0LapQR
===
@InternetsMagic And chorus shall weep with despair and they memorialize the lost souls who would never know the ecstasy of "analysis paralysis."
===
@eclecticcamel yeah - I'd say it's different too if you're talking to someone who's tried games a bit and it hasn't clicked as opposed to someone whose last game was Trivial Pursuit 20 years ago.
===
YAY! I got better again! 

Ok - I gotta walk away from this game! It's addictive. 

#Dorfromantik @_Toukana https://t.co/aiIdQ6xNEA https://t.co/R9Lc6APiyH
===
@boardgamerpinup @Ind1fference And they're still REALLY nice pens!
===
@PixelartMeeple @_Toukana Yeah... I'll likely pick it up AGAIN when it hits mobile platforms.

The more fat you eat, the more upset your stomach, bloating, nausea, and indigestion. 

No symptoms occur with sugar. 

Stomach symptoms can be cured with antacids and baking soda. 

The most recommended is Indian goose berry.

@425suzanne I think, from my experience owning a cafe, a second part is that it's ok for people to like board games that hobbyists roll their eyes at. Farkle, Yahtzee, even Monopoly have their fans, and they're allowed to like those while not liking Mysterium, Wingspan, or even Sushi Go.
===
@425suzanne It was such an outsized outrage about a game that had already funded and there was a lot of negging going on
===
@425suzanne @InternetsMagic There is a reason that this beautiful card exists. https://t.co/SVqNYEDoH5
===
@425suzanne @Cephalofair @_Toukana I like the game a lot - and I´m not posting my low-score for sure!
===
@425suzanne Yeah, I don't want to throw cold water on anybody's enthusiasm but giving gifts with the intentions of board game "evangelizing" or even just being pushy with getting games to the table can really have an adverse effect. Let them come to you.
===
@425suzanne Sure, as always, "read the room". But there def seems to be this idea that board games are for everyone, and I think when one comes to terms with the fact they aren't, they can maybe make better judgement calls in that regard.
===
@425suzanne Man I wanna play this
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana Oh! That looks real nice :) def gotta have that for me and for stream

Got to play several #Netrunner games w/new System Gateway 2021 decks last night on Jinteki.  Thanks to @ProjectNISEI for keeping such a wonderful game alive. It's incredibly addicting. @425suzanne @brdgamebarrage @BoardGameSnobs @michaeldilisio @boardgamerpinup @TheExelauno https://t.co/t4mJjyFs5A

@LandoJH @OurHiddenHistry @nandelabra so, this story is unusually one-sided.

@425suzanne @_Toukana Ahem... https://t.co/Yq0xKmhUhH
===
@alexiszotos Don’t forget @stlvaccinewatch
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana I think I'm getting better, but I feel like... I'm doing something wrong. Like, maybe my octopus approach isn't what I should be doing. :D https://t.co/R21795jikb
===
@425suzanne @boardgamerpinup Dang @425suzanne ! You are a bad influence by being so right and making me spend money. This game is so adorable and relaxing yet has that "let me just place one more tile" (for the next three hours) vibe.
===
@edavidds @nick_mcco @kj1313 Tweet through it hoss
===
@edavidds @nick_mcco @kj1313 The American empire appreciates your service.
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana I have to say seeing these posts today has got me really excited to try this game tomorrow. 😁
===
@AlyssaDepow Okay
===
@AlyssaDepow 
What happened to Stapy, Foldy, Marker, Bell, Eraser, Yellow Face, Fries, and Puffball? https://t.co/tp9hefi5oY
===
@AlyssaDepow 
What color is Saw’s eyes?
===
@AlyssaDepow because the black eyes blend in with the black background (dark).
===
@AlyssaDepow Okay
===
@AlyssaDepow I won’t be able to see them
===
@AlyssaDepow Mallow - Daichi
===
@AlyssaDepow 
What happened to the BFSU fighters? https://t.co/uYAj0vTxz5
===
@AlyssaDepow I think they turned Metal
===
@AlyssaDepow 
The BFDI Contestants use their BFSU designs on Contestants in Wonderland
===
@AlyssaDepow Okay
===
@AlyssaDepow Okay
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana Looks like you got a rail problem there, but maybe you can train yourself to choo-choose more wisely next time and stay on track.
===
@MaddieManges Well, please be quick and make me a full body image of Gongoro Kamakura so I can make Nicholas Gongoro for the Naruto version of Care Bears?
===
@MaddieManges What about Orbulon, Prince Haru, Bowser Jr., Toadsworth, and Paratoad?
===
@MaddieManges I dunno...
===
@MaddieManges Black (normally), White (in the dark). Also, why do black eyes turn white in the dark?
===
@MaddieManges Can you please find a full body image of Gongoro Kamakura so I can make Nicholas Gongoro for the Naruto version of Care Bears? https://t.co/FEZN6Znxyx
===
@MaddieManges What about Geno, Mallow, Dr. Crygor, Kamek, Sam, Orbulon, Prince Haru, Bowser Jr., Toadsworth, and Paratoad?
===
@MaddieManges What about Prince Haru, Bowser Jr., Toadsworth, and Paratoad?
===
@MaddieManges What about Mallow, Dr. Crygor, Kamek, Sam, Orbulon, Prince Haru, Bowser Jr., Toadsworth, and Paratoad?
===
@MaddieManges I dunno...
===
@MaddieManges What about Sam, Orbulon, Prince Haru, Bowser Jr., Toadsworth, and Paratoad?
===
@MaddieManges What about Ashley, Geno, Mallow, Dr. Crygor, Kamek, Sam, Orbulon, Prince Haru, Bowser Jr., Toadsworth, and Paratoad?
===
@MaddieManges Please hurry and make a full body version of Hibari so I can make Christy Hibari for the Naruto version of Care Bears!
===
@MaddieManges What about Dr. Crygor, Kamek, Sam, Orbulon, Prince Haru, Bowser Jr., Toadsworth, and Paratoad?
===
@MaddieManges Well, please hurry up already and make a full body version of Daichi I can use to make Jason Daichi for the Naruto version of Care Bears.
===
@MaddieManges Well do it quickly, because I'm wanting to see a full body version of Daichi I can use to make Jason Daichi for the Naruto version of Care Bears.
===
@MaddieManges Well, please hurry up already and make a full body version of Hosho I can use to make John Hosho for the Naruto version of Care Bears.
===
@MaddieManges What about Bowser Jr., Toadsworth, and Paratoad?
===
@MaddieManges That's because they ate yoyleberries, which causes them to turn into yoyle metal.
===
Thanks @425suzanne and @AlmostKirk for spreading the word about this gem! The gameplay and music of #Dorfromantik is so relaxing 😌 https://t.co/7CWpWIQKK7
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana I don't know about you, but MY score keeps getting worse because: "Placing this here is worth more points...but it LOOKS so much better over here!"
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana Ok, this is so pretty that I’m going to have to play it. Dangit.
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana I just bought this today despite only being able play it on my laptop, because it is extremely my shit. My wife is already addicted, and this is just the early access version. I can't wait until I can play it on my tablet.
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana It's also not matching some of the edges, so it won't ever get the +60 perfect bonus :(

This game can trigger AP when you try to make every piece perfect... which is impossible, because then you just have long chains that never score well.
Chill for some, agonizing for me.
===
@425suzanne Perfect mothering advice. Well done! 🤣🤣🤣
===
@suzidao @425suzanne @_Toukana Mood.

Although possibly the only reason I can get anything done ever

===
@425suzanne @_Toukana Wow! Thats impressive! Goals.
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana That river looks rad! 

Also, love these posts.
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana I got this based off your pictures and I have no idea what is happening but I’m having a great time https://t.co/7NCzZWQ2y4
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana This game is pretty great! Thanks for posting about it!
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana I keep seeing this game on my feed. It looks like it would be a nice change of pace from Hades and I may need to give it a try.
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana Ok I'm in!!! https://t.co/8a8cNWQDu4
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana This looks like a game I would love A LOT but alas I do not have a PC 😭
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana My score is also getting worse every game making me think I don’t really know what I’m doing 😂
===
@425suzanne It’s about 30-45 minutes once the rules are learned.  It’s currently undergoing a renaming/rebranding for obvious reasons.  It won 2nd place in a mint tin design competition but as I’m expanding beyond the tin.. I need a rename.
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana If you like this, I have a Tabletopia game I’d love some more eyeballs on.
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana Yeah my first game was my best score and my games have been going downhill from there.
===
@425suzanne Am I really so annoying?

No, its the NON gamers that are wrong!
===
@Ind1fference @425suzanne The colours are pretty! 😁
===
@425suzanne I snagged it while it was on sale. As you know my list of unplayed games on Steam is long. Worth playing sooner rather than later?
===
@MeadyOkerGamer @425suzanne Sounds like my kind of game! Thanks!
===
@425suzanne You misspelled throw them in a volcano
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana I was supposed to sleep tonight... This game is superb and an awesome relaxing time sink.  Thanks for flagging it up @425suzanne
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana This looks so excellent. I haven’t bought a PC game in years but this might change that.
===
@425suzanne @atlasgames Haven't heard of this one but I'm a little intrigued
===
@alleycatgames @425suzanne @_Toukana It's early access but went public a few days ago. It's so peaceful, I love it to bits
===
@425suzanne @atlasgames This keeps looking good
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana Ooo. I thought this was still in beta 🤩
===
@425suzanne @atlasgames Playing w a dice minor?
===
@425suzanne @atlasgames I'm very much looking forward to getting this one for just such life lessons.
===
@mdriddlen @425suzanne It's crushing though that my eldest child doesn't like board games because a) they have ADHD and get bored waiting for their turn, and b) got stuck in school in remedial math where they were basically abandoned to play boring board games so that's not a good memory.
===
@ron_halliday @mdriddlen @425suzanne there are a few, mainly party games so I guess it's something. We might try Quacks since there is not much waiting in it. It's more the reflexive dislike due to her awful experiences at that sad excuse for a school and those are not as easy to work around.
===
@425suzanne Next game night: "How can you not like Carcassonne? Are you an idiot?"
===
If only they were erasable kind... @425suzanne @boardgamerpinup https://t.co/1ZDd3mIxob
===
@saltyhorse @425suzanne @_Toukana I’m googling it, and it sounds like people have mixed results playing that way. I’d rather not spend money on a game I can’t run. 

Maybe I should buy Parallels or something?
===
@saltyhorse @425suzanne @_Toukana Oh! Maybe I could use that to play Monster Train...
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana Windows-only for now, though. 😢
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana This looks like a really good game! Thank you for sharing it!
===
@saltyhorse @425suzanne @_Toukana No worries! I'm sure I'll get a way to play it soon.
===
@425suzanne So true. Now that I am an avid board gamer and aspiring designer, I try to remember how "meh" my first experiences with modern board games were back in 200X, and that they never really clicked with me until 2014.
===
@MrSokkie @mdriddlen @425suzanne No luck finding games with simultaneous play and/or minimal down time, like roll-and-writes, or games like Boss Monster where there are things to look at and think about between turns? I hope you find something that you all enjoy!
===
@gilhova @425suzanne @_Toukana If you're on Steam, Steam Play works fine on Mac and Linux (I play this on Linux)
===
@gilhova @425suzanne @_Toukana Oh dang, you're right. While the underlying technologies all support MacOS, it was never integrated in Steam. Sorry :(
===
@425suzanne "That's cool - want to watch anime instead?" https://t.co/Htn8OBRm1F
===
@nick_mcco my interpretation 

cold war 
or
turtle pulling its head into its shell for safety/ retreat /surrender / flying white flag

no signs of U.S. utilizing the 2nd option.
===
@nick_mcco i'm the last person to inquire about translating Republiklan-speak. sorry.

best i can do is 
"words words racism words bigot-shitt racism, stealing jorbs, words, ehmurgrants superpower patriot, marika, words, racism"
===
@425suzanne I agree. Playing a game with someone who obviously does not want to destroys the fun for everyone involved. Awkward.
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana Interesting!
===
@nick_mcco @arb yes this is true and I misspoke or misremembered BUT it’s still gross and lame
===
@w_network @SamHeughan If he wasn’t a fictional character or if I was one ? Well it’s tough because sometimes I think I could love him to death and others I just want to cut his balls off ... so depending on the context something hugely romantico-kinky or something like he told Claire “you left me “
===
@425suzanne This makes me take special notice of the huge number of non-gamers in my life that are totally chill with me not caring about their favorite sports team, like a normal person with hobbies
===
@425suzanne All who doth not appreciate the joy and wonder of board games shall perish in the eternal depths of "not knowing how cool and fun it is."
===
@425suzanne I feel this in my soul.
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana One of those times that I really regret having no Windows machine.
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana I go back and forth between doing the challenges and trying for high scores. The 25 tiles with no mismatches will really ruin your land to achieve.
===
@425suzanne Is it ok if I phrase it “another #^%$ing movie” or is that less helpful?
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana What is this game?
===
@425suzanne I am working on the board game to fill the "likes Euros but prefers to think about college football" niche!

@envelopesofc
===
@425suzanne @_Toukana This game looks lovely. Hope it comes out on a non-PC soon so I can try it.
===
I don't know what Suzanne is on about, @penelopelambton! 😎 X https://t.co/tsr6OpSzyL
===
@425suzanne We're hurt but totally agree. We do love when folks give us a chance though if they're open to it. Games have changed a lot in the last 20 years.
===
@425suzanne YOU MUST LIKE WHAT I LIKE!!!
===
@travisdhill @425suzanne This is the exact example I was thinking of.
===
@425suzanne “How do I convince my wife to play games with me?”
===
@425suzanne Someone, maybe W Eric, wrote about that and it stuck with me. The most important factor in someone learning a game or trying games is desire. 

We as gamers often think it’s like a lock and we haven’t found the right key when really we need to wait for them to open the door.
===
@425suzanne I feel like not liking board games is a bit like not liking cats. “What you mean I have to submit to the weird whims of this thing to be allowed to enjoy it?” Its a position I understand but am also suspicious of 😂
===
@425suzanne @boardgamerpinup It's so relaxing .. the type of game where you sometimes ignore the 'best' play in order to create something super nice visually!
===
@425suzanne @AlmostKirk @_Toukana @Steam Ooooh that's pretty. *Heads to Steam immediatly*
===
