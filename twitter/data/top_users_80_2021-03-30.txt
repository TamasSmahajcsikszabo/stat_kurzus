Since the outbreak of the rebellion against climate change in London, the police forces have needed to change powers and legislation that would enable them to better deal with the peaceful protests that are not dangerous but whose aim is to create chaos.

I recorded an episode of @LGNOEpodcast last week, and it was great fun! Talked about Old-School D&amp;D, playing board games with your family, and definitely 100% for sure remembering the name of a brewery first try. Give them a follow and a listen! https://t.co/OTItE97cpu
