UPDATE: Kate wouldn‚Äôt let it be a tie, so we played another... and after the Usurper sat and waited and plotted for the entire game, he won me my lucky 13th game. I love how every card feels powerful at certain times. @flexbcx knocked it out of the park with this one. https://t.co/mZcbj5amKP

@Matthew_S_Brown @MeepleOverboard @GameMinimalist I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôre actually strong, but my game group typically leaves the halflings out of the running (or at least we did, maybe we‚Äôll reset it after Covid...) We had a couple games where someone dominated with solely dropping giant bands and it felt kinda dumb...
===
@radicalbytes @Ubeinn Because it was demonstrating there were still power struggles within a country trying to be colonized? Colonization doesn‚Äôt occur in a vacuum and there are still local variables at play‚Äîin the case of Pamir, that‚Äôs the jockeying for tribal power in addition to rebuffing colonists
===
@radicalbytes @Ubeinn I wasn‚Äôt assuming you didn‚Äôt know the game, I was just trying to form a response to your question about why you‚Äôre trying to win. I read through the comments to specifically cite Pamir, so when I found a thread on it I hopped in at the point of your query.
===
@al_cannon I know it's a bit long, but I re-fell in love with the suit icons I drew for this game a few years back, so I'm looking to kick all the tires and re-edit all the rules, but the aim remains: one central game with other games the unique deck allows. Thanks!
https://t.co/HWbODjs7TT
===
@GameMinimalist For sure! Gimme that self-doubt. Mmm mmm, disheartening.
===
@Lordeoftheboard @Bott_bott @colewehrle @PatrickLeder @direwolf @LederGames Dude, yes indeed! Also, that must‚Äôve been unreal!! Mega congrats on everything you‚Äôve done so far to be a part of that murderer‚Äôs row of commentators. Seriously, I can‚Äôt wait to check it out!
===
@geekygaymerguy You got your first Fauci Ouchie! Nice!!
===
A couple quick games of Hierarchy tonight. Man, I still love this game so much, even though I returned the wallet to my new @buttonshy Game Haul bag after getting edged out and then straight thrashed by my wife (which brings our record up to 12 and 12!) üí•üí•ü§ïüòÖ https://t.co/aMbUibdEYE

@PropTartMN Holy cow, yes. Went running yesterday morning and wrongly thought I could get away with a hat, neck thingie but no gloves. Oof.

@JoeSondow @geekygaymerguy Wait... as a lapsed PC user who‚Äôs getting back to that side of the aisle for the first time in... thirteen years, what are the not-folders actually even called?
===
Man, Amos is one of the absolute best characters in @ExpanseOnPrime. I mean, Drummer is also incredible, and I like aging Ashford quite a bit too, but Amos is just wide-eyed blunt force and raw emotional intent laid completely bare, and I'm here for it. https://t.co/Di0pkPd8rO

@JoeSondow And people defend that over folders!? THEY LOOK LIKE FOLDERS!!
*makes GIF IRL* https://t.co/EmAEyQEshh

@SpaceCatsPod @ExpanseOnPrime Awesome. Yeah, I was way late to the show and in my ‚Äúdad of two‚Äù mode, reading has almost completely fallen off my radar, but it‚Äôs great to hear the character rules in both formats!

@Bott_bott @Lordeoftheboard @colewehrle @PatrickLeder @direwolf @LederGames For real! Insta-add to Watch Later :)

@gamesformusic I‚Äôm not 100% sure if I‚Äôm answering how you‚Äôd like, but I guess when is say a game ‚Äúhas meaningful decisions‚Äù I‚Äôm talking about numerous decisions I deem as meaningful. Even in a game like that, there can still me meaningLESS decisions, either by design or in certain contexts.
===
@lastczarnian83 Holy cow, gorgeous!! One day I‚Äôd love to get one of our own.
===
@tonymakesgames I love quick projects that I can accomplish and check off my list!
===
@Ubeinn @radicalbytes Yeah sorry, I maybe came on a little strong, I read through the post as I was warming up from a morning run that was WAY colder than I was expecting. Maybe my iciness came through into my words, haha ü•∂
===
@jackson_pope Goblin Poker is back off the way-back burner, and I think I might be more in love with its suit icons now than I was when I first drew them! Excited to be developing this goofy deck of possibilities again :) https://t.co/OvgChu4Gf6

@tonymakesgames I have too many friends, so I regularly need to cull my list through social tension and acts of disloyalty.

@GIVEPAUSEhobby @Ubeinn I know what the game is about but I mean the designer himself doesn‚Äôt think it has much to say about colonialism either.
===
@Ubeinn @GIVEPAUSEhobby Yes, that‚Äôs true :)

In any case I have a lot less objections to Pax than John Company which I think does try but ultimaly fails in it‚Äôs goal of critique.
===
@GIVEPAUSEhobby @Ubeinn No worries. I too could have worded my response in a more charitable way. Have a good run!
===
@GIVEPAUSEhobby @Ubeinn Ah, ok fair enough.

@str_crossed are you gonna eat the rocks?

Number 3 - Glynda Goodwitch

Not quite as mom as some of the other moms on this list,,, she's most certainly mommy enough to me to bring her into the top 3 (i hated writing that wtf) https://t.co/0qNTfTcmEM
===
after damn near 20 weeks of saying i'm gonna watch jjk will i finally watch jjk
===
They give me similar vibes https://t.co/DUN9BXuMYU
===
@ahrwby02 idk dude you just popped off
===
@ahrwby02 i played it for like 6 hours then my controller broke. would recommend if you're familiar with the persona time management stuff if not persona 5 is a lot more lenient and perhaps a better place to start
===
that's my april fools 2021
===
@ahrwby02 with great power comes great responsibility
===
okay jjk livetweet how long can i go in one sitting
===
@adhdsoras i haven't actually played kh2 past the prologue but aren't they right?
===
Number 6 - Kali Belladona

do i even need to say anything here?? damn https://t.co/fuIN1zpLrD
===
Number 5 - Ozpin

fuck you ozpin stans he's not even that hot https://t.co/G0guK8blTC
===
Number 2 - Terra Cotta-Arc

Melanin, Glasses do i really need to say more? https://t.co/I6QJDgErJZ
===
Notable exception
- Raven Branwen, probably first place if she wasn't a shitty mom
- Salem, see above
- also i'm not sure if jinn and ambrosius count but they would be high on the list
===
@jerry_era regardless i think you should get one for personal use /hj
===
@ahrwby02 Hi still up kill me I'm jules
===
@BigBoiTsu i feel this one dude,,, i'm in a fucking abusive relationship with that game /hj
===
@jerry_era "original sin" wtf
===
number 10 - Taiyang Xiao Long

i don't see the hype tbh,, first blond men? not my type,, no that's basically it https://t.co/kUj6nvtLgY
===
I am gonna rewatch the first three episodes cause I don't really remember them
===
@adhdsoras hi going to destroy my wifi i'm jules
===
Number 7 - Saphron Cotta-Arc

not much to say here i think she's cute https://t.co/V8tk9s3udL
===
Number 1 - Ghira Belladonna

I literally lack the words to describe my attraction to this man. just,,,,, he's a bear. he's a dad,,,, he is the perfect dilf. https://t.co/Vs39awTEzo
===
@nndsoulmatism i've been meaning to change mine,,,

===
@jerry_era actually there might be a better photo but idk if i can find it
===
@jerry_era he looks his best here
===
@jerry_era hi "sane" i'm jules
===
Number 4 - Qrow Branwen

While definitely sexier than those below him, he doesn't quite have enough dad vibes to bring him into the top 3 https://t.co/df2WHkWq3t
===
@ahrwby02 i don't even remember the intro
===
@jerry_era damn,,, if i only i noticed it earlier
===
@ahrwby02 persona 5 is pretty fucking sick imo

if you think you'll like the persona 4 characters more by all means go for that one i just know some of the restrictions for the true end in golden (which idk i'm assuming you'll play) is harder to reach,, espcially so in a blind playthrough)
===
@adhdsoras hi slowly going insane i'm jules
===
as apart of my april fools joke i've decided to make a top 10 list of milfs and dilfs in rwby (or people with milf/dilf energy)

emphasis on my own opinion
===
@BigBoiTsu cannot believe you disrespected seominsoo like that /j
===
@ahrwby02 gen lock was mid at worst,,,,,,
===
forgot that one the genlock characters has my deadname i will now never think about the show again
===
@adhdsoras i don't doubt that
===
@SAL_U_TATIONS happy birthday !!
===
okok goodnight yall
===
@jerry_era "we put the fun in functional" i stg if you didn't buy this for the comedy
===
@jerry_era i can only count so high, you can hurry it up /j
===
Number 9 - Summer Rose

i like her design but with her not having any screentime i can't consider anything than my own headcanons and that's not enough to put her higher on the list https://t.co/qjSVE0oGBc
===
for april fools i will be participating in milf/dilf discourse for 24 hours
===
turns out i have a lot of thoughts about persona 5 who would have thought
===
@ahrwby02 you've put it in the spotlight
===
@jerry_era deadass might do better than this as a canadian
===
@jerry_era what's the harm?

@ahrwby02 wait it isn't semen keys /j

@JHowardBrainMD @MLevitt_NP2013 This is what he'll be remembered for - not his lifetime of accomplishments.

@andymackenzie6 @Graciecosplay Now I'm trying to cast Jackson in a ThunderCats movie and... 
Ya know, for a movie now, I'd have to cast him as Jaga.

Back in the 80s/90s? Not so sure.
===
@Graciecosplay Worst case scenario?
We get a "ThunderCats on Modern Earth" movie. But even then, Sonic the Hedgehog turned out okay. So...

But i do hope they go with the original format, or a hybrid of the OG and 2011 version, maybe adapt one of the comic storylines? 
We'll see.
===
@Graciecosplay Having just finished GVK...
I can see it. No spoilers, but at times it had a very similar vibe to the OG and 11 versions, mixing sci fi and fantasy without taking itself too seriously.
Cautiously optimistic.
===
@Graciecosplay In terms of medium, honestly I think I'd go with Avatar styled motion capture; even a "live action" one would be predominantly animated with VEX anyway, so it makes sense, and we get a human performance.
Unless of course they go fully animated.
