@aranmlewis The wider systemic problem is the use of "partner" contractors - large contracting companies that sub-contract the work a further 2-3 levels down. There's rarely post-inspection of this work by officers, as contractors are allowed to "mark their own homework".

@aranmlewis That's why I believe independent, neutral inspectors are a must, &amp; not the LA-favoured system of involving residents as tightly-controlled non-paid amateur inspectors, either.
