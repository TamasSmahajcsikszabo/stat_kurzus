@INArteCarloDoss What societal purpose do total return swaps achieve other than to allow hedge funds to lever up to the hilt and create systemic risk? Time and time again. And too often Fed has to ride to rescue by inflicting financial repression on the masses to keep house of cards from falling.

@captainskrilly @pepipop Before mass collectivization in 1926-29, the total harvest in Ukraine was lower than after collectivization in 1930-33. The 1932 harvest is almost the same as in 1928, which caused famines in the cities and the introduction of ration cards. Cleaning losses in 1932 were 40%.

===
@allthelovenora @wmistyIes do you know how to read threads?
===
@allthelovenora @wmistyIes now read it again because it addresses everything, tell me why is he‚Äôs homophobe without using that thread full of shit, do you know what homophobia is, how are you gonna call him homophobe for the same things your fav has done and more and unlike him never apologized for?
===
@allthelovenora @wmistyIes I‚Äôve told you this 5 threads are completely fake, why didn‚Äôt you read the thread addressing every rumour that I sent you instead? and again how are you gonna call him names for the same shit your fav done and more? no apology as well
===
@allthelovenora @wmistyIes openly homophobic you mean like this? https://t.co/wygO1tYMTs
===
@allthelovenora @wmistyIes since you don‚Äôt know how to read here‚Äôs the thread again https://t.co/CLz30QuQHe
===
@allthelovenora @wmistyIes I‚Äôm bisexual and you didn‚Äôt even read it, did you? show me the part where he‚Äôs homophobic without using that thread twisting his every word
===
@allthelovenora @wmistyIes my fav has hold himself accountable years ago when it happened, apologized and never been heteronormative again, maybe if you held your fav accountable then, he wouldn‚Äôt have heteronormative mindset NOW, focus on people who didn‚Äôt apologiZe instead
===
@allthelovenora @wmistyIes or maybe the fact that he‚Äôs finding two men kissing funny?
===
@allthelovenora @wmistyIes focus on your fav invalidating lgbtq+ community in the present, not liams one mistake he owned up to years ago

The rules of the challenge are a budget of $50 total, individual cards capped at $1.50, and you get one Splurge card worth up to $5. Price is lowest printing shown in Scryfall, and I'm abusing the hell out of that last clause by running as mail foils/showcases/SLs as possible.

Total conspiracy thought - Cards announce 26 man roster Sunday, so the "injury" that Matt Carpenter comes down with tomorrow, Monday March 29th, seems more legitimate.  He starts and gets "hurt" 3-29, and you heard it here first.

@BluntPans I enjoy your streams ü•∞

I love having self-promo in my Discord, it's a great way to share communities. The only time I don't like it is when it's posted at the same time that the owner is streaming. But I want people to feel like they can promote their streams. Especially since it notifies me too. https://t.co/uXty5eQ9Z7

@ObanGaming GOD THIS IS THE BIGGEST MOOD 

Also hi you‚Äôre wonderful and I adore you, you‚Äôre fucking valid

This feels really weird but like

I‚Äôve been really enjoying streaming lately? I‚Äôve stopped thinking about it as a chore and it‚Äôs become something that I‚Äôve just really enjoyed pouring my time and effort into. 

It‚Äôs been less about the views and more about the fun I‚Äôm having.

I HAVE SO MUCH MORE DESK SPACE FOR STUFF

@A_TypicalQueer Sometimes I get jealous because other streamers are growing faster than I am, but I take the time to slow down and think about why I started streaming. I didn‚Äôt do it to become partner or gain a huge following, I did it to create a safe space and a community.

We know the roster. We know the season begins April 1. So we've got a few days to run some Cardinals win total polls. Depending on Twitter's optimism, may have to roll a few per day but we'll start here: Over or under 81.5 wins for the Cards this season?

@beneeta_k @beforeyouplay_ @FloodgateGames @VincentDutrait @Junazaru Wait, you throw colors? Why don't we all do this? That sounds like fun!

@cublion Guess it‚Äôs time:
Cards      90-72
Brewers. 88-74-2
Reds.        86-76-4
Cubs.        76-86-14
Pirates.     61-101-29
 76 is a really high number. I think if this team is out of the race early, you will see Hoyer clean house. That could drop the win total.

@beneeta_k @FloodgateGames @VincentDutrait @Junazaru Happy Holi Beneeta!!! Wish we could throw colors with you one day!

@TheCunce @who_knows_where @JonnyBones 10 mill for Ngannou is still more than fair as the b-side.  If you think the rest of the cards make more than 5-7 mill combined you don‚Äôt know the mma pay structure.  That‚Äôs 30 million total for fighters.  You‚Äôve got 70 in ppv, + a variety of sponsor, gate merchandise money.
===
@Victorious1612 @CriticaI_Damage Jon Jones has headlined 15 ppv cards.  He‚Äôs sold more than half a billion in PPV.  Jon Jones PPVs alone have probably generated close to 10% of the total ppv sales in the companies history.

In Rentz, you play without seeing the cards and you disregard the King of Cups with points in minus, you say that a good hand will cover it. But the hand could be another's choice and it's not only the King of Cups there, it's all in minus, the total cards, a total disaster.

Do not close your cards when you pay them off. Credit utilization(amount of credit you use/Amount of available credit), average age of your accounts, and total number of accounts will all go down if you close the account. Paid credit cards are good. Closed credit cards are bad. https://t.co/BOysoVH0kp

@a_mar_hum Did you close the credit cards or just pay them off?  If you closed them the points drop makes sense because closing shortens the average lifespan of your accounts and also reduces the amount of credit you have available to you (thus increasing your total debt ratio).

@britompkins @Armanyosh @mcmansionhell Meaning, you have a total of 10k available to you in some form through your credit card(s). 

Your credit score will be HIGHER if you consistently keep a 3k-4k debt on your credit cards. If you pay off that 3k? Your score goes down.
===
@britompkins @Armanyosh @mcmansionhell The "sweet spot" with credit cards is around 30-40% of your total debt. This is the proportion that the credit score companies look for. More than 40%? Your score goes down. Less than 30%...? You score also goes down. 

For example: Say you have 10k in credit card $ limits...

@sheepycutie basically if you attack somebody who isnt at the lowest life total, you draw a card and get 2 counters somewhere

if you attack two people who dont have the lowest life total you get 2 cards and 4 counters

Y'all. When you go to a store to spend multiple gift cards on a single purchase, the store runs a card, it deducts that amount from the total, runs the next card, etc. till it's paid for.

Why can't online retailers do this too? And if they do, or there's an app, someone tell me.

@Fuknutz @EndonozMrs Instead of a press conference, why not just distribute Joe‚Äôs cards &amp; notes to the press &amp; public?

It would be easier than when he reads it.

For the younger generation, it will have to be in audio with cartoons though. We‚Äôre just one generation away from total illiteracy.

Biden appeared to repeatedly lose his train of thought early on in his first press conference as total embarrassment-in-chief Thursday, asking reporters if they wanted him to go into detail in his answers, forgetting questions and relying on cue cards  https://t.co/WltQOxGSBV
