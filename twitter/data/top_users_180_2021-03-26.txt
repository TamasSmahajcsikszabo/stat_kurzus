we're all short but they're all the same fucking height and here i am like four inches shorter than everyone else https://t.co/1Li4vdXkLY

reminds me of the dude who told me he couldn't be homophobic because he shipped ladybug https://t.co/0Zdlk7ggqo

it's pissing me off especially bc our mask mandate is over april 6th and just. ugh.
===
i don't think a single mcyt fan is neurodivergent they just don't give a single fuck about the awful shit those men do and want to avoid being called out on it
===
and when tomorrow's episode is called "fall" then what
===
she's also scared it's gonna make me infertile..... who's gonna tell her
===
is it bad that i'm actually hoping the vaccine makes me infertile bc then i'll never have to take birth control

so true of her &lt;3 https://t.co/HCiI4KY8dx

@cydoniasands i admire your business mindset but also please tell me you still go to therapy
===
rewatching v1.... ruby was so happy &lt;/3
===
that is a cool headcanon but i call him a loser because he's a little bitch not because he's clumsy
===
what if, if rwb doesn't end up falling in, sometime in v9 we get a parallel to ruby's speech to jaune in v1 and he tells her that she's not allowed to give up
===
sobs i love them so much https://t.co/vVILNpgIXU

my mother wants to hold off on letting me get the vaccine because "it might affect ur growth" ma'am i've been the same height since age 11 what fucking growth

the soup is trans https://t.co/ZDIUOtMPs2
===
even if yang was born as soon as strq left beacon, qrow would still be 40. 

as it stands he's probably closer to like 45-50. stop shipping him with women in their early 20s
===
i think of all subjects the best to be awful at would be math bc there's so many programs that can just. solve any problem for you
===
as she should https://t.co/jVioBhAi0q

every time i tweet some random gay shit trying to be cute with elizabeth it gets popular https://t.co/1GpHRZOVTa
===
homophobic that i literally just walked away. how anticlimactic
===
some of y'all are lying about being nd and it's so painfully obvious and insulting
===
maybe if ur main symptom is being "hyperfixated" on horrible people then u might not be neurodivergent, actually
===
@H0UNDBL00MS i mean mood
===
....what if the board game they play in v2 is foreshadowing where team rwby will be in v9. weiss doesn't fall in so she makes it to vacuo, blake falls and ends up in vale, yang maybe falls in raven's portal and ends up in mistral with her (?), and ruby gets stuck in atlas
===
i'm out for river's blood for killing my pretty gf https://t.co/Nkz2apsK2H

@SCHNEEKOSISM are you just gonna... live the rest of the game as a sheep??? i
===
rewatching v2 and i can't believe there are people geniunely saying ironwood's v8 behavior came out of nowhere

i don't think yang will actually see summer bc she's grimm and like not dead but i do think she'll pass out and dream about her
===
@seamcnkeys roman torchick
===
,,, i actually am a sun kinnie
===
the blake and yang pfps make this even funnier
===
foul https://t.co/eSlRwgiRVo
===
oomf calling me a bottom bc i like mean women &lt;/3
===
@Mimeco2 they're kinda
===
rwbytwt i love you dearly but when a new person starts watching maybe u should try laughing silently instead of shittily hiding spoilers in their qrts
===
y'all are weirdly obsessed with saying slurs it's so :///
===
if you think raven got pregnant straight out of beacon how does it feel to be wrong
===
in addition to being the token white and cis of team rwby weiss is also the token neurotypical
===
@bennettskulfi ur welcome bestie sjdhdg

i'm gonna sob do british people actually call sugar mommies "sugar mummy" that's so ajfhdhdhd

pyrrha was weiss' celebrity crush u can not convince me otherwise https://t.co/CAJxAgpVtC
===
@Mimeco2 i think ur right &lt;3
===
@ahrwby02 no bc almost everything in the earlier volumes is either plot relevant or foreshadowing and that board game had no plot relevance at all so maybe..
===
v9 is just v4 but better https://t.co/PFkGSKVWyE
===
freckled yang lives in my mind rent fucking free
===
ohh i just had a horrible thought
===
when yang comes back in v9 buff as hell and freckles all over her body

the existence of the crusades in the remnant timeline is horrifying for so many reasons but also it implies the existence of a remnant pope which is very funny to me

i know bumbleby is canon bc whenever i'm watching rwby around my father and they come onscreen he starts calling them slurs
===
weiss and jaune r the token cis of their teams i will not take criticism
===
@AMagicalMaggie what can i say i love mean women
===
there is just SO much foreshadowing in the early volumes of rwby,, this shit is so cleverly planned and executed idk how the htdm can watch the show and geniunely be like "um this isn't what monty wanted :/"
===
so true https://t.co/zyUXrl7A9Y
===
the volume finale credits when they list the people they're grateful for and they list crwby's pets &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;

too many vegans (white vegans) see the goal of veganism to be completely eradicating human consumption of meat and dairy products.

your goal as a vegan should be dismantling the *industry* because it is colonialist and ruining our planet. nothing else. https://t.co/9qFwuMveie

@Schneezburger yeah it's.. weird that it has such a large fanbase but at the same time is so obscure. idk
===
@Mimeco2 i disagree i think they're 5'6
===
the idea of complete abolition of meat and dairy consumption will always be classist, racist, and ableist. that shouldn't be the goal and it's disgusting that so many vegans feel like it is.
===
our little corner of rwbytwt only has like 40 people so i think y'all forget that rwby is among the biggest animes/cartoons out there
===
it's what she deserves
===
@jerry_era i can't even argue.. she'd want to commend them on a good job
===
bye the way they used blake blushing at yang https://t.co/Nz12cc7s9T https://t.co/iPhK6g2QKz

@BoterBug @ItsRitzii @TheFaldor @accursedabbie @andrewjlavigne In other news... wtf is 'BDA Work' in Star Wars??
===
@BoterBug @ItsRitzii @TheFaldor @accursedabbie @andrewjlavigne Wait that's an actual unedited page that just name drops 2 DIFers? Whaaaaaa...

It must... mean something.

Narrator: "It meant nothing"

@ItsRitzii @BoterBug @TheFaldor @accursedabbie @andrewjlavigne Story of my life right there.

...two of them and the RPG sessions, all the way through to the pool room as the just gut-punching crescendo. Just absolutely heartbreaking. And the fact it's a story about 2 nerdy asian women that fell in love over a night of not-D&amp;D, and it feels totally natural, is amazing.
===
Also, running around Talos I with my rad not-D&amp;D group following an entire treasure map scavenger hunt to unlock the secret treasure that our crafty DM set up for us, is like, so wholesome and amazing it's physically painful to contemplate right now.
===
Rewatching an old let's play of Prey (2017), and the entire subplot with Abby and Danielle is still some of the best environment-based storytelling I've ever seen in a video game; from slowly discovering the map pieces to finding the game, piecing together the story of the...
===
@BoterBug @ItsRitzii @TheFaldor @accursedabbie @andrewjlavigne Yeah well... if you're gonna bring "reading" into this like some sort of nerd...
===
@2MomsGame @RhiWynter @Jellyfish_GS I imagine it's a little stronger with more players but 2 player has a unique puzzle that's semi co-op of making sure the automa mannequin vamp doesn't win.
===
@beneeta_k @dani_standring @WoosungGames @PlumpyThimble Thanks, adding them all now 😊
===
@kjrevia To be honest, I don't know where my accent ends and my speech impediment begins 😅In Australia everyone thought I was from New Zealand, and in Canada everyone thinks I'm British haha. But recording myself has been helpful in thinking about how I speak.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle It's tough though, there's not a lot of consistency in the definition of game 'reviews' right now and what purpose they're trying to fill. Content creators are largely individuals setting their own standard and trying to stand out as opposed to published by a formal publication.
===
@NoPunIncluded Here's an idea to avoid the political debacle: don't do a war crime.

So I got up to some Cinnamon Toasted nonsense yesterday, filmed a video and felt the best home for it was TikTok.
So I now have a TikTok account 😄

I've only seen @RuelGaviola's streams, looking forward to seeing more of him 😄

===
Tried this for the first time last night, and it's a great trick taking game, with a great theme and unique mechanical implementation of not being able to look at your cards. Can you resist the urge? https://t.co/dPtUGc8tL1
===
@burntislandgm Ooh very exciting, looooved the first game!
===
@rf_seattle @beth_sobel Perhaps it helps to think of this in the context of accessibility rather than pure cost. Accessibility is broader but certainly an important factor in deeper discussions of the hobby.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle I'd love to see more 'journalism' around board games, distinct from reviews. But the whole point of a 'review' is to appraise it as a retail product. Shut Up and Sit Down have been talking a lot lately about price as an important factor for a purchasing decision.
===
@jonathanhliu @beth_sobel @rf_seattle I definitely want more writing like that, and again this is semantics, but at that point maybe it shouldn't be called a 'review'. There's a lot of baggage and expectations tied up with that term.
===
@NJekich @tgryphgames Unfortunately, I don't know that this series will be available at retail, pretty sure the box set was a Kickstarter-Exclusive box-set. But would love to see the games sold individually.
===
@PlumpyThimble you know what you need to do https://t.co/NoTWmhAA9W
===
Broke out Vamp on the Batwalk last night. Neither of us are super familiar with trick taking so started with a quick round of Spades to cover the basics with @RhiWynter and she immediately went on to completely trounce me at Vamp. Pumpkin Spice lattes are out, swimsuits are in 🔥 https://t.co/CmTeRyX2Ms
===
@EminteaWASD I've seen others come up with nice versions but mine was a pretty burnt mess and couldn't taste much of it. Either I messed up the oil, or deep frying sugar is a bad idea 😂
===
@Jellyfish_GS @RhiWynter Let's just say I let her win to stop the Automa from winning 😅
===
@kovraystudios Yikes. For better or worse Instagram is much harder for having conversations or putting your real self forward. Most people seem to be there to just talk about games and nothing else, so can be harder to curate your following. But I appreciate you making your position known ❤️
===
@AspieGamerGirl @RhiWynter Aww thanks so much Luna, glad to have you in the 'club' 😄
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle The Video Game industry is much bigger but has only recently in the last few years found a way to formally break out from news/reviews into more journalistic discussions with sites like @waypoint. They don't formally review games but cost and accessibility are still discussed.
===
@markh110 @ThinkerThemer @MeepleU @LudoPhoebe Damnit, starting to have serious regrets about leaving Australia 😭
But so glad y'all are getting to celebrate!
===
@PlumpyThimble Is this how Vampires feel trying to resist the urge to drink blood?
===
@rf_seattle @beth_sobel Oh totally, I don't *personally* have an issue with the usage of the word, but there is certainly a contingent in the community trying to formalize it's usage and I can understand where they're coming from.
===
@kovraystudios Though @RhiWynter's favorite Growlithe is up there too!
https://t.co/O1eNyS6Xbl
===
@4ChitsNGiggles I've only played on BGA, and quite enjoyed it. But definitely want to try it in person to help visualise the information across the various tracks.
===
@rf_seattle @beth_sobel I'd love to see more writing *about* games without the need to formally 'review' them, but that's difficult to monetize as either a publisher or a content creator. Most of what little money and demand there is goes into 'Should I buy this game' 🤷‍♂️
===
Play Vamp on the Batwalk for the silly vampires. Stay for the humbling experience of how close we are to animals in the difficulty of resisting the instinct to look at your own cards (I failed the test).

===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle @BGFeast I think one of the points that Dan makes in his article is specifically about not being a review that's geared toward influencing a purchasing decision at all, but more a cultural critique. I'd compare it to, say, an analysis of a book.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle @BGFeast If I wrote about, I dunno, the Hunger Games and analyzed what it was saying about the government, I wouldn't necessarily talk about the price of the book.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle @BGFeast In fact, I just realized that I rarely include price of books in my book columns (partly because price could vary based on hardcover/paperback) but perhaps because I had an assumption that the book could be read separately from the purchase.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle @BGFeast Granted, there's less likely to be the "mass market" paperback equivalent of a board game after the hardcover has been out a few years.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle @BGFeast What I mean is that the sticker price of a new retail game is not necessarily something that every individual who wants to experience that game has to pay for themselves.
===
@rf_seattle @beth_sobel @BGFeast We always put the price up front on GeekDad, along with things like player count, game length, age recommendation. The hard part is that the price can vary so much except for Kickstarter pledges. If it's published, I list MSRP but it's often available cheaper than that.
===
@inquiry_meeple @rf_seattle @beth_sobel @BGFeast I remember that! It's not a common practice though.
===
@rf_seattle @beth_sobel @BGFeast I was thinking: how often do movie reviews mention price? Probably rarely, because the cost depends on what theater you go--or if you wait long enough for it to be on streaming. And a review of that sort should be relevant long after the film leaves theaters.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle @BGFeast The way I read it I felt like it was more like "maybe we should focus less on buying games and telling people to buy them," in a way that encourages people to consider the hobby without feeling like they always need to pay startup costs to do so.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle @BGFeast Yes, but they're also in that weird place where you may or may not spend money on it to experience it. For what it's worth, books have a pretty wide range too!
===
@rf_seattle @beth_sobel @BGFeast Right. If the writing is intended to guide a purchasing decision, then it makes sense to have price, which is why my reviews will always have them.
But I like the idea of game analysis distinct from a consumer advice. Whether we call that a "review" is less crucial to me.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle @BGFeast I always try to be conscious that not everyone wants to (or is able to) spend a lot of money on a game and try to avoid "this is a must-buy!" type of statements, and I also hope people find ways to enjoy games without having to buy all of them themselves. It *is* a pricey hobby.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle @BGFeast Kickstarter (especially with exclusives that will not be available later in retail) makes this much harder for sure.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle @BGFeast Ah, but if you want the collector's edition box set with slip cover... that's more akin to game with a bunch of deluxe components. :)
===
@rf_seattle @beth_sobel @BGFeast A restaurant review, on the other hand, almost always includes prices--because the only way to experience that is by spending that much money at that place.
===
@beth_sobel @rf_seattle @BGFeast Sure, and I don't omit prices on principle--I just realized it's something I didn't include because of the way I write about books, which is more like how I'd tell a friend about it. When I talk to friends about books, I rarely mention cover price or page length.
===
@BraininaJar2 @beneeta_k That's the one I want, it looks great!
===
@jonathanhliu @inquiry_meeple @beth_sobel @BGFeast Yeah, I knew there were just a few examples. There's also games like Hive or Qwirkle where form factor variants come out that cut cost (both mass market, of course).
===
@jonathanhliu @beth_sobel @BGFeast Though I think this is a future some publishers would love ;-). $100 Kickstarter followed by long lived $40 MSRP version!
===
@beth_sobel @jonathanhliu @BGFeast Yep, and I actually adding more reviews that take price out of the equation is another angle to adding folks to the hobby. Because there will be people who appreciate them that have a harder time when price is up front.
===
@beth_sobel @BGFeast I think a key part of this is actually about whether a review's key goal must include guiding you on whether to acquire it right now.
===
@beth_sobel @jonathanhliu @BGFeast Not entirely, but that is growing and I think it may continue to grow. Regardless, I play many games I never purchase whether that's at a game store or from a friend.
===
@BGFeast @beth_sobel This seems more like a semantic issue. I don’t see the work review as being that restrictive.
===
@jonathanhliu @beth_sobel @BGFeast For better or worse, the word review has been used for this kind of thing for ages. I suspect the modern "product review" avalanche spawned by the internet is one reason some folks come with a more narrow definition.
===
@beth_sobel @BGFeast I could see listing the price going either way in a review like this. I'm not sure it's necessary in this day &amp; age where you can search and find the price in 10 seconds, but I think that's different than whether or not you review the game with cost as a perspective.
===
@beth_sobel @jonathanhliu @BGFeast As a reader of such reviews, I would not mind a listing after the completion of the review. I don't need it, but it wouldn't bother me. I could see a general indication of price and availability.
===
@beth_sobel @jonathanhliu @BGFeast Books have more variance here, though not usually in early print runs which follow a pattern.
===
@BGFeast @beth_sobel Yep! And I know that the (relatively small) size of the market means you won't see a lot of truly independent reviews because you can't make a living doing that. But that also means it's great when someone manages to provide those kinds of reviews.
===
@beth_sobel @BGFeast I get that, and suspect it will hit a decent number of people that way. I see this more as saying acquisition doesn't need to be the only focus.
===
@jonathanhliu @beth_sobel @BGFeast I think at the root of this is a simple principle - talking about whether it's valuable to experience the book.
===
@beth_sobel @jonathanhliu @BGFeast But "imperfect" is a good description of it.
===
@beth_sobel @BGFeast I can understand that. I don't feel that way for myself because I know I can find it quickly and that it might even vary depending on where I get it from (Kickstarters excepted). And I also don't always expect a review to be guiding me to purchase or not.
===
@beth_sobel @jonathanhliu @BGFeast Yes, I thought about this as well. Movie prices are suddenly a topic due to the pandemic &amp; streaming. But otherwise they aren't mentioned in reviews much except indirectly (IMAX, 3D, etc.).
===
@jonathanhliu @beth_sobel @BGFeast Yes, I think this is a key point as well. A lot of folks want to focus on the review as something guiding me as to whether I should ACQUIRE the game. And that's a valid review for sure. Very needed. But I think the perspective that eliminates that is also incredibly useful.
===
@jonathanhliu @beth_sobel @BGFeast Movies theaters are actually hilarious in this regard since they rely on concessions so much. Base movie price - great value (except for larger families)! Actual cost after succumbing to food purchases - ugh!
===
@beth_sobel @jonathanhliu @BGFeast I was going to note that Dan didn't comment on whether to list prices or not, but his most recent review does not.
===
@jonathanhliu @beth_sobel @BGFeast I'm never going to argue that reviews in general should omit pricing discussions. Many (perhaps even most) should include them in their perspective, and possibly put them up front.
===
@BGFeast @beth_sobel A review is simply a critical assessment of something. Every review of anything comes from one or more perspectives that are chosen by the reviewer (with possible influence from a publisher). Not sure we need to narrow the set of perspectives that are valid to call it a review.
===
@rf_seattle @jonathanhliu @BGFeast Before would make the review more accessible, but sure.
===
@jonathanhliu @rf_seattle @BGFeast I appreciate that!
===
@rf_seattle @jonathanhliu @BGFeast For sure, but most folks don't have access to the kind of community that exists here.
===
@jonathanhliu @rf_seattle @BGFeast Yes, okay, that's fair. My point isn't to do with books at all. If someone is brand new to the hobby and reads a review and is so invested, only to discover that they can't have what it's about, how is that a good thing? Literally just listing prices and availability stops that.
===
@rf_seattle @jonathanhliu @BGFeast Being from a fine art background, I come from a place of review that is very idea driven and concept heavy. Even those typically list prices. Listing prices just gives people a way to relate to their abilities to participate in whatever it is.
===
@rf_seattle @BGFeast Yeah I don't think every reviewer needs to factor cost in their review, but just not mentioning it anywhere in the review feels like an incomplete review.
===
@rf_seattle @jonathanhliu @BGFeast This just feels very 'money is no obstacle' in a hobby where money is a huge factor, I guess.
===
@rf_seattle @BGFeast I agree, but I think for the people for whom acquisition is a non-issue, adding a price listing wouldn't be a major issue for their enjoyment. Most folks look to reviews of products with an eye to buy.
===
@rf_seattle @jonathanhliu @BGFeast I clarified
===
@jonathanhliu @rf_seattle @BGFeast Also, I don't even appreciate it for me, particularly. I don't like massive mini games so I can usually buy any game I am interested in at an expected price point. However, adding context for new folks only strengthens the hobby!
===
@jonathanhliu @rf_seattle @BGFeast Yeah, libraries make it an imperfect comparison, for sure. Games don't have a library corollary.
===
@BGFeast @rf_seattle Yeah I think if your entertainment budget is 20$ and you fall in love with a review of a game, you'll probably figure out a way to later buy that $80 game but you sure will be salty / sad when you look it up to buy it immediately and can't.
===
@jonathanhliu @rf_seattle @BGFeast Sure, but you might list the book specs, like cost and how long, etc. I don't think it has to be discussed but to just omit it on principle seems weird.
===
@jonathanhliu @rf_seattle @BGFeast True, I suppose I was thinking new-ish text based books, where you'd get pretty much whatever you want for 5-30$
===
@rf_seattle @BGFeast Fair. But to me, leaving it out clearly says 'money is no obstacle', which is... cringey.
===
@jonathanhliu @rf_seattle @BGFeast They do, though. Games aren't free. If you have a pal with games you have a pal with at least some measure of disposable income. If you have a game store you can game in, you live in a place that supports that. These things are integral to the hobby, unfortunately.
===
@jonathanhliu @rf_seattle @BGFeast Movies have a set price, though. Granted, by theater, but it's a generally known quantity. Books have a range, but it's usually fairly narrow. Games have a MASSIVE range.
===
@rf_seattle @BGFeast It just seems to me that stating the price in the basic specs doesn't have to change what you want to write about it, but it does help people understand their relationship to it, which I think reviews should be all about!

@TheFaldor @BigDamnArtist @BoterBug @accursedabbie @andrewjlavigne Is that an actual, physical book?!
===
@TheFaldor @BigDamnArtist @BoterBug @accursedabbie @andrewjlavigne That's like a babies toy!
===
@BoterBug @BigDamnArtist @TheFaldor @accursedabbie @andrewjlavigne Mate, you're canon. Or at least, you were. Now you're just Legends.
===
@rf_seattle @jonathanhliu @beth_sobel @BGFeast Pretzel put out the cheaper plastic version of their games after the wooden ones had been on market for some time

===
@BGFeast It is a heck of a lot of icons to start with, and it's not the best at imparting the info well (even if it does make sense when you've played it) but it's still a good time and I'm lucky I learned it on the real life board!
===
@beneeta_k It's always the good color combos that make me a fan.
===
@beneeta_k I'm so fond of the contrasts between the warm tones of your skin, the coldish pink of the wig, your dark eyelashes and brows and the white highlights! Really pretty. This wig was a great idea!
===
@beth_sobel @BGFeast @rf_seattle But that's just a few clicks. I would mention the price too, because it's a core feature, but I don't think people with a tight budget (source: me) get too exited before checking that aspect of the game out. I just think it would be polite and convenient to save me the research.
===
@beidousbxtch someone needs to draw this cause it’s fucking hilarious
===
@beidousbxtch IM FUCKING CRYING CAUSE  KINGFISHER’S LONGER LINE COULD’VE POTENTIALLY CAUGHT HER LMAOO

@beidousbxtch Robyn was shit in V7 but she's been pretty good in V8, Yang was my favourite character until V7 where I felt like she was alright and her character development has 'fallen' in V8
===
@beidousbxtch I fucking love this dork.

@BG_HotTakes Damn I'm jealous 🤣 sure it'll be great what ever you pick to play 😁

@beidousbxtch yang gets confirmed as lesbian and the cishet men try their hardest to ignore it just like blakes disability

@beneeta_k Amazing!!!!!
===
@BGFeast @RhiWynter That’s nice of you. My wife would let the Automa win before letting me win😂
===
Fall was so last year, it’s summer time now! https://t.co/twq65kLRh7
===
@BGFeast @RhiWynter What can I say. Fall was so last year😂
===
@BGFeast @RhiWynter Also, 10 point is an absolute thrashing😬 

I would say pretty confidently that less than 10% of games end up with someone getting 10 points.
===
@BGFeast @PlumpyThimble Thats exactly the feeling we were going for🧛‍♀️🩸
===
@2MomsGame @BGFeast @RhiWynter If you want to give it a try, let me know and I can see what I can do😊
===
@2MomsGame @BGFeast @RhiWynter Yeah the 2 player version we get a lot of feedback on. I’ve had quite a few people tell me they like playing it at 2 players best as it’s more strategic.

I’ve also had good feedback from people that “aren’t good a trick-taking games” saying they enjoy it
===
@2MomsGame @BGFeast @RhiWynter Send me a DM with your address and a good shipping notification email😊
===
@beidousbxtch nope
===
@beidousbxtch you are down so bad but me too
===
@beidousbxtch YOU'RE NOT WRONG

@Jellyfish_GS @BGFeast @RhiWynter Definitely!
===
@BGFeast @RhiWynter @Jellyfish_GS How was this at 2? Emily is a big fan of trick taking games and will almost always trounce me.
===
@Jellyfish_GS @BGFeast @RhiWynter Good to know! Definitely sounds like a fun game to bring out when group gaming can resume in the After Times.
===
@tgryphgames @BGFeast Then I'll buy a copy whenever they are available :) As soon as I posted my previous tweet, I saw that this was a KS game and pre-orders are closed haha oops
===
@BGFeast @tgryphgames OMG, how did I not know that this game existed?! So much tasty food art. SOLD.

God this is such a mood cause like

If a female character pisses off the misogynistic dude audience, 9 times out of ten I absolutely adore her. And probably view her as a lesbian, which is true for both characters here https://t.co/KcmoJFBNmC

@BGFeast @tgryphgames i'm certainly not average in that respect. I don't think anyone, apart from the developers, has played it as much as I have. Even loosing is fun, because most times it’s fair and I just misjudged the endgame. I really love #eiyo. I dream about it sometimes… 😆

@Behavior2020 Krispy Kreme makes sure anti-vaxxers don’t feel left out of free doughnut offer. https://t.co/ElkcFxmMrf
===
@Behavior2020 Donuts are great! If the incentive encourages vaccination, wonderful! The sequence of reactions &amp; actions by Krispy Kreme reveals the weaponnizing of "discrimination" by a mainly white middle/upper class US pop &amp; resulting policy which legitimized the Anti-vax view.

@beidousbxtch Cut my man’s some slack he’s trying. Plus he’s had a huge upgrade since Vol 3, he’s pretty up to par with well trained Huntsmen like the rest of RWBY and Ren and Nora. Impressive for how much he’s had to catch up.
