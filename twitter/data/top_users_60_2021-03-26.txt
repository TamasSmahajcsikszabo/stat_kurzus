@IAVaccineAlerts  I just called Iowa City Hy-Vee (waterfront) to set up my second vaccine dose, and they said they have a fair amount of cancellations for the today. Might be worth calling to try and get a spot!
===
Thank you @IAVaccineAlerts- 3 of my coworkers got vaccine appointments yesterday. We all are feeling a little safer in our public servant jobs!
===
@rea_geee @kpottermn @MNVaccineAlerts Absolutely, no offense taken, just sad that we couldn't do better.  But a few months from now when we're wandering around and seeing humans? Totally worth it.

@jeffrhorne @durf73 @uihealthcare The county and state allocations are still working through some tiers/priority system.  Walgreens and Hy Vee are doing 65+ or under 65 with pre-existing conditions (i have diabetes and a bmi over 25, for instance)...  so you may have better luck with hy vee.

@jeffrhorne The walgreens data can be somewhat deceiving from time to time.  It has a slightly longer lag time than hy vee, so it's a few minutes old by the time I can get my hands on it.
===
But most importantly, please please please, look around you and find someone to help get their shot, especially older folks, people in underserved communities, people of color, undocumented folks, etc.  The sooner we get more pokes in more arms, the better.
===
If you're doing Walgreens, make sure you're already logged in on both the desktop, and the app.  If the initial search doesn't work, try cities in the nearby area (Burlington/Mediapolis, Iowa City/Coralville), or try using 
 zip code instead of city...

If you're having trouble seeing Walgreens openings that are available according to the listing, try searching another town nearby, or try the mobile app. Something is wonky (technical term) with their search logic.

Just a reminder... Walgreens data is a few minutes behind, and sometimes these openings are only one or two spots (especially midday alerts), and walgreens search is... Strange.  So if it doesn't appear, one of those three things is probably to blame.

@AmberLaronde The data source for Walgreens can be a few minutes behind, and they go super quick.  The appts went up at 6am, and will likely do so again tomorrow.

@tinamarie0302 The Walgreens search is... Problematic...  Some have suggested trying zip codes vs city names or vice versa. As well as searching nearby cities instead of the exact one you're looking for.  What city are you trying for?

@sptswf @Stephan33691485 @IAVaccineAlerts Yep...I'm there too! I just posted on the MN, IL, MO, and NE pages to see if I can help there! 🤣 #adrenalinejunkie

@IAVaccineAlerts If anyone struck out today, please reach out for help! I have no one on my waiting list for tomorrow, and I am happy to help! &lt;3

@AmberLaronde @IAVaccineAlerts Someone suggested yesterday that you search all of Iowa because it can be a little glitchy. Also, I'd be happy to help, as I'm watching for appointments all day for people. Just reach out to me! ❤

===
@Kayk859 @IAVaccineAlerts From what I've read, it's acceptable to get the 2nd dose 21-42 days after the 1st dose. Hyvee is allowing you to schedule the 2nd one at the same time, but it's always at least 21 days days out.

@carann5291 @IAVaccineAlerts I've been asking people if they have a Walgreens account and asking if we can reset their password so I can have access. They can always reset it when you're done. Hyvee is still faster to get appointments at, but it's worth a try.

@SaraODonnell24 @IAVaccineAlerts Had one scheduled in Burlington then they emailed me it was done in error
===
@SaraODonnell24 @IAVaccineAlerts Trying to find a second Pfizer dose for April 3-April 7, anytime.
===
@ontabletop @RogerAbbott20 @OspreyGames Shieldwalls should have been a core rule
===
@IAVaccineAlerts if anyone needs help getting their appointment time, I have time to help. Send me a DM.
===
@LastxLeviathan @SteffieEffie1 @IAVaccineAlerts I agree with you. We will all get it, it just takes time. I don’t think it’s gloating either, just another small step in stopping the virus.
===
@3minboardgames @brennanoonan Gift From God, how you doin’? ;)
===
@3minboardgames @brennanoonan my full name is fame-bright crown servant of St. Catan
===
@3minboardgames hey i didn't pick it 😛
===
@PlayRenegade That looks super pretty
===
@MrSokkie @ellalovesbg @gmtgames No aliens though :) 

One of my next game ideas has huge XCOM vibes though
===
All the faction designer articles for Red Dust Rebellion are up now on the GMT site. First we looked at the Red Dust Rebels themselves. Who are trying to create independent martian rule https://t.co/UdA4WyH3vA https://t.co/vtpSqwLkR2
===
@mr_orgue They simply need to reach out to a certain contractor, he could move it pretty easily. 

He'd probably demand mutant rights or something as payment though https://t.co/VDKsXeurCO
===
Our third article was on the Martian Provisional Government. Who's goals include dealing with all the immigration and housing issues, making a stable government and winning over martians to the idea of shared rule. https://t.co/wrnIZE2xke https://t.co/UwSKAIVOFg
===
I'm really pleased with these designer articles, and i think they give a good overview of the factions in Red Dust Rebellion. How they work and why they are fighting. This is not a clean sterile mars, is nasty and dirty. 

You can preorder the game here. https://t.co/8Z5o45EIYm https://t.co/jvcJPClXCS
===
Our fourth faction guide was on the Reclaimers. A group who believes that humanity should adapt to the planets we live on, not the other way around. They oppose terraforming and excessive consumerism and capitalism. https://t.co/ty5NNswMD0 https://t.co/afP3vE1EaO
===
@michelappleton @BLACKCAPS Lol, statsguru says biggest win ever. 290 runs. Oooof
===
@brennanoonan Lol, humble sounding :) 

I'm Descent bearing Christ who lived in the stronghold of Michael 

Names are weird
===
@soupness @MrSokkie @ellalovesbg @gmtgames Lol, Aliens on Mars in an expansion. What a silly idea ;)
===
We then looked at the Corporations, who's main goal is profit, and preparing the planet for terraforming. But they also want to crush any resistance and keep their assets protected.  tagging @ellalovesbg for obvious reasons :)  https://t.co/JXhRAlfXpd https://t.co/PpvOKPnRMr
===
And today's article is on the Earth Government and satellite warfare. EarthGov is a 5th faction, who's control shifts between the Martian Gov and the Corps depending on how the conflict is going. Satellite warfare involves mass drivers and drop pods. https://t.co/ksFvC2bfZc https://t.co/ojNgp7Y07s
===
@michelappleton @BLACKCAPS Wonderful stat

08: McCullum/Marshall v Ireland was a horrific game if i recall. Totally 1 sided and brutal hitting from those 2 at the top of the order. Must have been one of the biggest wins in ODI history too
===
@allwrongthink I feel compelled to be the only person to say poor Taumaranui. They used to be so proud of being on the main trunk line back in the day
===
@Publicwrongs @michelappleton @BLACKCAPS LOL. Ooof indeed
===
@3minboardgames I backed this on spec ‘cos I’m a fan of COIN and I really like your work. 
The world-building you’ve got in here really puts it over the top for me. Like Netrunner-quality theming. 
Amazing!
I can’t wait.
===
This is one of those times when every new piece of art of the game just drags you further in. This will be a blast of a game. https://t.co/Mgd6jeWDdX
===
@3minboardgames @mr_orgue Unfortunately he hasn't been vaccinated yet...
===
@3minboardgames @MrSokkie @ellalovesbg @gmtgames Can add aliens in an expansion . . . Hahaha.

@Kayk859 @SaraODonnell24 @IAVaccineAlerts My husband is a physician and county board of public health chair. A friend is running into a timing/travel issue with her second Pfizer dose and he cautioned her against less than 21 day interval.
===
@IowaStateBeth @SarahforIowa @RobSandIA @IAVaccineAlerts @bjohn20 @VolunteerIowa They certainly deserve an award from the state but maybe @IAGovernor and her administration would be too embarrassed to own up to the fact that they didn’t do their job so private citizens had to step up and do it.
===
@SteffieEffie1 @LastxLeviathan @IAVaccineAlerts Unfollowed  Blocked
===
@IAVaccineAlerts just an FYI, like five people in the waiting area where I went for my shot found theirs because of you. I can't stress to you the love that's out there for yall and how you've helped.
===
@SteffieEffie1 Why...is it gloating and not celebrating something that *was* hard for lots of us? It took me three days stalking @IAVaccineAlerts and jumping on notifications at 4am to get my #1. I have a compromised immune system and now I can sleep at night. That's not gloating imo?
===
@SteffieEffie1 @IAVaccineAlerts Here's my take. I'll do the same thing when I can finally get approval for a shingles shot (I've had shingles twice, it's miserable). It's not about being a meanie poopy head. It's more, being a marginalized disabled person and being visibly *protected* for a change. 1/2
===
Thanks, but all the love goes to @IAVaccineAlerts ... they're really doing amazing work for people. I couldn't find any appointments locally. I had to drive all the way across town, but without them I'd of never thought to look. They care about people, and we need that atm! https://t.co/Tc3sv88HgA
===
@LastxLeviathan @IAVaccineAlerts I'm happy that you got your shot, and sorry that it took so long. It was directed at the general public. But yeah, it is gloating. We don't have it. We want it. I don't get the urge to throw it in peoples faces. It's rude. I'm not saying you shouldn't have it, but why gloat?
===
@LastxLeviathan @IAVaccineAlerts I'm sorry that you're a marginalized disabled person. I am. The tweet wasn't directed at disabled folks who should have been at the front of the line.The tweet was about why throw it in peoples faces?Nanny, nanny, poo poo, I got my shot and yooou didn't.That's all. It's childish.
===
@LastxLeviathan @IAVaccineAlerts We had to drive an hour and a half to a different county to get our first jab. It's crazy. In the county that I grew up in (HUGE, HUGE place) there is NO vaccination site. They have to drive across a toll bridge. Reprehensible.
===
@mikes_d69 the day ppl were arguing about kathleen and if she was a t*rf
===
@adrockurockwell reminds me of the time i used a shampoo as lotion by mistake 🙃 my arms were ITCHING

@mikes_d69 I know exactly who all u mean 🙃
===
@YauchAdamMike My fave part was when huntress kept getting annoyed with everyone calling her the crossbow girl
===
@paulswhores wait it makes a noise? 😳
===
@biglasagna69 happy birthday Juno! how r u doing these days? hope ur doing well? have a great weekend ahead ❤
===
@proudnavyfamily @IAVaccineAlerts How sorry for the world 🙄🦋🌛
===
@SaraODonnell24 @IAVaccineAlerts Can I ask you, Sara, do they allow you to get the 2nd dose a day or two earier than the 21 day wait for Pfizer?
===
@Amy_Siskind In Iowa, a private citizen has created @IAVaccineAlerts . I've helped several people get appointments with this site.
===
@SaraODonnell24 @Stephan33691485 @IAVaccineAlerts Hmm- It’s weird when you start to feel twitchy cuz you don’t have an appt to schedule.
(Helped someone learn the process this AM and she had an appt in minutes!) Maybe an “adrenaline rush of getting an appt for someone” is kinda unsettling in someways...🤔🤨
#adrenalinejunkie 😜
===
@IAVaccineAlerts And, boom!, one more scheduled. Come on everyone... fill those appts❣️🤗😉
===
@thedicetower Removed by uploader?
===
@SarahforIowa @IAVaccineAlerts @bjohn20 Well done
===
@kpottermn I know it's not an ideal solution, but @IAVaccineAlerts  has helped thousands of people in Iowa - esp young people who can secure appointments for older family/neighbors/friends/etc. I would give the Minnesota version - @MNVaccineAlerts - a try, if you're able.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts @kpottermn @MNVaccineAlerts I should have said “not a perfect solution” - we in IA absolutely LOVE how much you have helped the state.  What isn’t ideal is our state gov leaving us to fight hunger games style 🙃
===
@IAVaccineAlerts I get my 2nd Pfizer shot in the morning.The road was bumpy, starting with hitting all the websites I could find that had information about shots, places that might guide me toward them, and any number of calls and visits toward getting that 1st shot
Ironically, it was @IAGovernor
===
@IAVaccineAlerts I get my 2nd Pfizer in the morning.
===
@DruidCityGames @thedicetower I haven’t seen the other nominees, but Tidal Blades absolutely deserves these nominations!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts
Been spamming all of my Iowa, Minnesota, and Illinois friends in their Facebook direct messages for the last 2 weeks about your Twitter feed. It's messages like this that make it all worth while. Thank you so much, Brian.

@3minboardgames @michelappleton @BLACKCAPS THE biggest in terms of runs. 290 runs. Ooof.

@IAVaccineAlerts Hy-Vee, Drake U Harkin Center clinic on Tuesday.

@AlyssaDepow Hey Toad, you finally understand the rules!
===
@AlyssaDepow 
What happened to Key and Dollar’s eyes? https://t.co/Ml24S0tCxb
===
@AlyssaDepow Big Speed Patrol
===
@AlyssaDepow Everything to get out of this game! Thanks, guys!
===
@AlyssaDepow Now that’s a funny face!
===
@AlyssaDepow Nice Play, Toad
===
@AlyssaDepow grabbing Patrick's board game and shaking it off of Patrick
===
@AlyssaDepow Someone say my name!
===
@AlyssaDepow Game Over!
===
@AlyssaDepow Huh? Oh, you know what, you are right. That was a good game.
===
@AlyssaDepow Toad walk away Milky Follows Toad
===
@AlyssaDepow The Police car drives away and Mario Appears on the game board box at the end of the game
===
@AlyssaDepow Grab Toad and threw him in the police car
===
@AlyssaDepow putting a piece of the game board in his mouth and shaking his head like a dog - Dances Happily
stomping on it with both feet out of insane anger - tap dances
===
@AlyssaDepow Oh, and I saw here you are a repeat offender. You’re going to real jail!
===
@AlyssaDepow 
What happened to Ice Cream and Map’s eyes? https://t.co/WRTs5tDIgO
===
@AlyssaDepow Oh, I get the rules alright. The rules are that it doesn't matter what the player rolls! You can just make up whatever it means! [takes the dice and rolls them] So I could just roll the dice and say, "Automatic Winner!
===
@AlyssaDepow Puts a light bulb out of Mario’s head
===
@AlyssaDepow 
What’s the Magic word so the compound numberblock turns into a figured out numberblock?

@AlyssaDepow The Contestants

@AlyssaDepow Purple Toadette

@AlyssaDepow 
Who will be trapped in the rubies in BFDI: a New Generation?
===
@AlyssaDepow Destruction to private property
===
@AlyssaDepow Not yet! [writes on the rules card] No player may declare themselves.
===
@AlyssaDepow Okay you did it. You made that up. This game is awesome! Great game!
===
@AlyssaDepow throwing Patrick in the air and breaking it in half - Spins around
===
@AlyssaDepow Jumps up and down
===
@AlyssaDepow Maybe it was a glitch
===
@AlyssaDepow Hello there!
===
@AlyssaDepow Writes the rules card and gives it to the Blue Toad
===
@AlyssaDepow Okay
===
@AlyssaDepow Nice job, Toad! You’ve Won!
===
@MaddieManges If the police car drives away and Patrick appears on a game board box at the end of Patrick! The Game, what happens at the end of the Mushroom Board Game?
===
@MaddieManges What does Mario say that will replace "Hey, Squidward, you finally understand the rules!"?
===
@MaddieManges What will Toad say that will replace "Oh, I get the rules alright. The rules are that it doesn't matter what anybody rolls! You can just make up whatever it means! [takes the dice and rolls them] So I could just roll the dice and say, "Automatic Winner!"?
===
@MaddieManges Who replaces the High Speed Patrol in The Mushroom Board Game?
===
@MaddieManges What does Mario say that will replace "Not so fast! [writes on his rule card] No player may declare himself "Automatic Winner.""?
===
@MaddieManges What does Toad say that will replace "Anything to get out of this game! Thanks, Officers!"?
===
@MaddieManges You mean Milky, right?
===
@MaddieManges Will that replace grabbing Patrick's board game and shaking it off of Patrick, throwing Patrick in the air and breaking it in half, putting a piece of the game board in his mouth and shaking his head like a dog, or stomping on it with both feet out of insane anger?
===
@MaddieManges Please hurry up an upload an image of Mito Uzumaki's full body!
===
@MaddieManges If Patrick writes on his rule card and gives it to the police, what does Mario do?
===
@MaddieManges What will Mario say that will replace "Good job, Squidward! You've won!"?
===
@MaddieManges What does Toad say that will replace "Somebody say my name!"?
===
@MaddieManges What will Toad say that will replace "Huh? Oh, you know what, you're right. That was a good play."?
===
@MaddieManges Well, do it quickly, because I need a full body image of Mito Uzumaki to make Day Dream Mito for Battle Ninjas (Naruto version of Care Bears).
===
@MaddieManges "I figured myself out!".
===
@MaddieManges What does the Big Speed Patrol say that will replace "Destruction to private property."?
===
@MaddieManges What will Mario say that will replace "Game over!"?
===
@MaddieManges What will replace throwing Patrick in the air and breaking it in half, putting a piece of the game board in his mouth and shaking his head like a dog, or stomping on it with both feet out of insane anger since Toad likes the Mushroom Board Game?
===
@MaddieManges If Nancy O'Malley and the Highway Speed Patrol grab Squidward and threw him in the police car, what do Milky and the Big Speed Patrol do?
===
@MaddieManges Which member of the Big Speed Patrol takes the place of Nancy O'Malley?
===
@MaddieManges Since Squidward hates Patrick! The Game, Squidward grabs Patrick's game board and shakes it off of Patrick. Then he throws Patrick in the air and when Patrick landed, the game breaks in half.
===
@MaddieManges Give me a reason.
===
@MaddieManges What does the Big Speed Patrol say that will replace "Oh, and I see here you are a repeat offender. You're going to real jail."?
===
@MaddieManges Tell me
===
@MaddieManges Since Squidward hates Patrick! The Game, he says "You did it again. You made up another rule! This game is the worst! Stupid game!". What does Toad say since he likes The Mushroom Board Game?
===
@MaddieManges What will replace putting a piece of the game board in his mouth and shaking his head like a dog and stomping on it with both feet out of insane anger since Toad likes the Mushroom Board Game?
===
@MaddieManges Turned white in the dark because black eyes blend in with the black background.
===
@MaddieManges Turned white in the dark because black eyes blend in with the black background.
===
@MaddieManges What will Peach say that will replace "Nice play, Squidward!"?
===
@MaddieManges Oh, if the mini Patrick pushes the light bulb out of Patrick head and lights it up, what does the Mushroom do in Mario's head?
===
@MaddieManges Can you please find a full body version of Mito Uzumaki? https://t.co/XEHRffAStJ
===
@MaddieManges What does Peach say that will replace "Now that's a silly face!"?
===
@MaddieManges If Squidward tries to walk away but Nancy O'Malley and the Highway Speed Patrol follow him, what does Toad do but what does Milky do?
===
@MaddieManges What does the Blue Toad cellmate say that will replace "Welcome back!"?
===
Thank you @IAVaccineAlerts. My first vaccine completed today @HyVee. Thank you for your efforts!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts If you happen to be awake around midnight, check availability.  I found DSM appts at Hy-Vee shortly after midnight this morning.  Good luck
===
@IAVaccineAlerts I got my appointment! Thank you!! I have to travel 45 minutes but I don’t care!

@bjohn20 @IAVaccineAlerts Well Done Brooke !
===
@IAVaccineAlerts @bjohn20 You helped me secure my appt and ones for my aunt and uncle.  Keep it rolling!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts @jenngalles Not sure if you guys are setup with vaccines yet.
===
@bjohn20 @IAVaccineAlerts Thanks again.  Sad that private citizens had to figure this out.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Ha, yes I figured. But I wouldn't consider it a big city necessarily, just the only damned place around offering appointments and bookings online! Thanks for the updates though, maybe one of these times it'll work out!

@IAVaccineAlerts FYI I got a text from Unity Point stating that they are now distributing covid vaccine for patients but you have to have the code supplied within the link that is specific to each patient.  First available appt I saw was 4-10 but as you say, YMMV.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts @klerenah8 Gotta wait til 4/5.  Everyone in my house is eligible except for my 19 y.o. daughter and as tempting as it is to snipe an appt for her, I'm waiting it out.  If you're in eastern Iowa, be patient and be very persistent

@IAVaccineAlerts Does anyone have any hints as to how to get a second dose at a Walgreens? I drove to Illinois to get my first dose so would like to get one closer. The Walgreens site won’t let me schedule until the day before my 2nd dose appt. I need Moderna.
===
@SarahforIowa @IAVaccineAlerts @bjohn20 Without them, we would have never been able to find appointments. I just used Vaccine Hunter to find a Moderna appt. for my second dose. I drove 2 1/2 hours for the first dose and was now able to find somewhere local. They are lifesavers!

We should send @IAVaccineAlerts to the Suez Canal. That guy can get anything moving. https://t.co/Lv0PSqeRC7
===
I wish @RepCindyAxne also gave a mention to @IAVaccineAlerts. They have done more then Iowa’s 211 line could ever do. https://t.co/6RUvur055S
===
@bramiha @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA That’s fine, but @shfarnsworth  is making false claims
===
@bramiha @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA My parents used it and have already received their 2nd dose lolol
===
@bramiha @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA The comments on the post seem blissfully unaware of it.
===
@bramiha @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA Okay. My point is the original post which apparently a lot of people enjoyed gauging likes contains false and misleading information. I think we should all strive for the truth.
===
@bramiha @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA Both political spectrums need to stop spreading fake claims and patting themselves on the back for claims that aren’t true
===
@bramiha @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA How does it not work?
===
@bramiha @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA Oh Brady the original author replied but then deleted her tweet lol
===
@shfarnsworth @bramiha @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA https://t.co/PrcFvpS0fq       Totally glossing over the fact that the state of Iowa has had this website to bash on Reynolds 😂
===
@bramiha @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA There are lots of opportune failings to point out. Just don’t go out and point out ones that aren’t correct.
===
@shfarnsworth @bramiha @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA The website I linked provides vaccine appointments from providers who... drum roll.... notify you when an appointment is available specifically for an individual
===
@bramiha @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA Agreed. But the post is still false and misleading.
===
@bramiha @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA Ok, but the post literally mentions the gov. failing to establish a centralized platform for vaccinations which as you can see via the link I provided is clearly “Fake News”

Thank you @IAVaccineAlerts for helping me get my ouchie from Fauci. Get vaccinated, my friends.
===
So good to see these tweets filling up like this. It was just over a wk ago when it was still really sparse. The supply is there, so get that #FauciOuchie y’all. https://t.co/mnZQ9pEumz
===
@IAVaccineAlerts So, tomorrow as in the 26th?
===
@sara_d_nelson @IAVaccineAlerts It is an amazing site. Game changer.
===
@thedicetower to answer Tom’s question on the latest podcast, I’ve always used TTR for Ticket to Ride
===
@IAVaccineAlerts @IndivisibleCRIA I get my 2nd dose tomorrow. https://t.co/VfrT192XwK less worry.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts @SaraODonnell24 Thank you I will tweet her!!!!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts help my family needs the vaccine, please!
===
Looking for a #Covid #vaccine in Iowa? I found this site really helpful! @IAVaccineAlerts
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Where are you getting the CR Walgreens data?
===
@durf73 @IAVaccineAlerts I ask @uihealthcare, which is my primary, and they told me "Sorry, you are not 65".
===
@IAVaccineAlerts I am using the Walgreen's App and I am not showing any in Iowa City
===
@IAVaccineAlerts I was able to snag an appointment in Dubuque for tomorrow after work!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts By the time I got signed up with the stupid Walgreens site, the Cedar Rapids appointments had disappeared //sigh//
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Butttt didn't schedule the followup, I should have, doh!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts How about Dubuque?! I’ve been having fits for the last week trying to get an appointment for my aunt. Success today!!! Many, many thanks!
===
@jeffrhorne @IAVaccineAlerts Jeff-when I was helping my aunt find an appointment on the Walgreen’s app, I found. Was most helpful to get her information filled out under the Am I Eligible? Button- and then at the end it looks for appointments near you, I just kept refreshing, it took 1hr but it worked
===
Exciting to see @TheOpGames nominated for @thedicetower Game Awards! 

The teams and designers have worked hard on these games and it's cool to see them nominated. Lots of fantastic tabletop games are coming out.

Hey @GovInslee why isn't WA doing this? We even have a few software companies willing to help. You were quick protect. Why so slow to open up safely? https://t.co/bCHhbA9lDN
===
@FunnyLittleFro1 @paulswhores Like a pop sound
===
@IAVaccineAlerts How old are you supposed to be,to get the vaccine?
===
@dicebourbon @IAVaccineAlerts Thank you!!!  There is not a lot of choices in that area!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts THANK YOU!! Thought that would only be for Hyvee appointments since Walgreens is different! ❤️❤️❤️
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Anyone have info on how to get vaccine at Oelwein dollar? Trying to help a professor in Decorah and that seems to be the closest right now!
===
@tennismom97 @IAVaccineAlerts Nightingale and Hartig in Waukon are scheduling vaccines. I was just there this morning and got the first shot. I think they have more supply for today than people scheduled so you might be able to get in today. https://t.co/0UCcEwCxxR

Also, tell her about a recent episode of @thedicetower that you enjoyed where she introduced you to a new game, or a title from @RestorationGame that you love, or even just how much you love seeing pictures of Maple destroying dog toys. (6/?)

Iowa Folks! Just had luck signing up for a vaccine using this site: 
https://t.co/4Oiz8oXgde
@IAVaccineAlerts

@IAVaccineAlerts LOTS of appointments available in Rockwell City, 2 hours west of Waterloo. I was at this week's clinic and they're very well organized.

@RubyforIowa @VoteVarley @IAGovernor I got my appointment from following @IAVaccineAlerts. In addition to posting available appointments, I have seen several folks offering help for folks to get appointments AND offering transportation! If @IAGovernor won't help, we have to help ourselves.
===
@LaurenSteenhoek @KymEtzel @IAVaccineAlerts When it asks if your insurance is on file with your Hy-Vee pharmacist, answer "yes." If you've ever used any Hy-Vee pharmacy anywhere, it likely is ... if not, you can give it to them when you arrive for your vaccine. Do not bother with uploading the photos.
===
Boardgame Breakfast was on live but you can watch the replay on @thedicetower YouTube channel. There was another spin off show from Happy Days besides Laverne &amp; Shirley. If you can figure that out you know what boardgame I will be showing off. Check it out. https://t.co/ESApeNM86f
===
@jeffrhorne @IAVaccineAlerts @uihealthcare What about county health, we got them to send vaccine to the clinic to do public workers?
===
@jeffrhorne @IAVaccineAlerts Jeff have u checked with ur county health dept or with ur family doctor or whoever does ur follow up care from artery surgery? Just a thought?
===
@RubyforIowa @IAGovernor I follow @IAVaccineAlerts it has been helpful in finding open appt at Hy-vee and Walgreens. The CR, IC, Waterloo sites have been a bit hard to get appts, they go fast. So does Vinton. I got my appt in Oelwein.
===
@RubyforIowa @IAGovernor @IAVaccineAlerts I agree, it is frustrating.
===
@Angie_Merchant @IAGovernor @IAVaccineAlerts I’m glad you got an appt, Angie! Yay!!! There are so many folks who honestly have no idea how to even attempt to get an appt and just say forget it in defeat. I’ve spoken to many of them.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Just got off the phone with Ames Walgreens. They say they are getting inundated with calls. They have no appointments available
===
Decisions, Decisions....😃 https://t.co/lEGkLkHbkT
===
@RMSchmieder @IAVaccineAlerts Resident or receive medical care from a Plymouth County healthcare provider.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts PLYMOUTH COUNTY is opening up appointments to ALL 18+ https://t.co/2hdbVGNSwX or 712.546.3646. IF YOU MAKE AN APPOINTMENT KEEP THE APPOINTMENT.
===
@lissaemtb @IAVaccineAlerts Are you required to be a Plymouth County resident for this?
===
@IAVaccineAlerts please accept my unfollow as a massive thank you for helping me get vaccinated. If only the whole world had your heart. ❤️
===
@LaurenSteenhoek @IAVaccineAlerts I don’t understand how this works. I keep my phone and computer on 24/7 in the hope that I hear a tweet with the right location and then redo the form?
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Any idea why are there literally no updates or openings for Council Bluffs
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Not in Waterloo according to the Walgreens website.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts More appointments opening up at the Public Health office in Grinnell. Clinics will be held on Monday, 3/29 and Wednesday, 3/31. Phone lines open at 9am on Friday, 3/26. Call 641-269-9200. No residency requirements. https://t.co/6ugHP40zRU
===
@Bethbroo @IAVaccineAlerts Wow! That’s great! Thanks for helping all of them.
===
@Poemama8 @IAVaccineAlerts These in this tweet were all Walgreens. Make sure you have a Walgreens account &amp; log in. Might also consider downloading the Walgreens mobile app.
===
@_mekasum @IAVaccineAlerts You need to have or create a Walgreens account. It’s been suggested on here to use their mobile app.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Been looking for Des Moines, West Des Moines area. I've tried zip code and City. It may just be problematic life you said. I've been able to get HyVee ones for family so may stick to that...
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Has anyone had any luck with Walgreens? As soon as I see it posted I jump on and it always says appointments unavailable. Is it Walgreens site or are the appointments just going that fast?
===
@IAVaccineAlerts That’s my hometown pharmacy!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Walgreen's in Davenport has openings
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Walgreen's in Davenport has a few openings.

@IAVaccineAlerts Am I the only one here who has never seen or heard of Thrifty White until this page??

@ontabletop @OspreyGames Another one! 😯
===
@boardcubator @thedicetower Yayy, thx for the kind words and congrats too! 🥳
===
Big thanks to Mike and also the viewers for choosing Eternal Palace as their Crowdsurfing pick of the week on @thedicetower stream out of 25 live Kickstarter projects.

There's just a week to go so if you are curious be sure to come see for yourselves Link in the next post! 1/2 https://t.co/UI3IDxMbet
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Thank You!  I was able to get two appointments in Polk County.
===
Great review of our latest EXIT releases @ontabletop https://t.co/JLrchG0aHF
===
@lupe1515 @AliciaEmanuel @IAVaccineAlerts For me, some zip codes worked and some didn't even if they're right next to each other (definitely within the '25 miles')
===
@chrismartin100 @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA True statement’
===
@shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA Forever grateful to Brian.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Cedar Rapids don’t have any according to the web site just to let you know :) thank you for posting this as it has helped several people get the vaccine
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Walgreen site shows nothing in Cedar Rapids
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Geez, I get my appointment made and go back to make one for my husband and everything is booked now. All in like 5 min.
===
@AliciaEmanuel @IAVaccineAlerts I have found that I can’t use the zip code at all. I have to type in the name of the city and choose it from the list. But if I use the zip code, it says appointments aren’t available. Just in case people want to try that route as well.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts How do you actually get an appointment if you’re not eligible?
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Walgreens does not allow use of their website more than 24 hours before a second vaccine’s due date.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Hoe do I sign up???
===
If you are trying to get COVID vaccinations for eligible family in Iowa, I can’t recommend @IAVaccineAlerts enough. Got three parents in after some early morning openings were tweeted. TYVM
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Using the website from a phone works but you need to select the location from the list before clicking “Search”.  You can use zip to have the list pop up, but you must click on a location before clicking search for it to work. https://t.co/C9t703qO0P
===
Scored appts for both doses of the vaccine. Feels like I won the lottery! https://t.co/yqA2oeZ8hG
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Walgreens CR are gone already. This is insane.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Two appts booked. Thank you for the alerts!!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Thank you! I know a lot of people that are using this to get a vaccine scheduled.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts You’ve been a Godsend!! Thank You!!!!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts It also wasn’t letting me schedule someone’s second Pfizer unless I said their first one was three weeks from today, rather than three weeks from Monday, when she would be due for her second dose.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Yeah, for me it only seems to be allowing me to schedule at the location at the top of the list even though there are many locations with appointments.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts I used the website.  Don't search by zip code, when i did that it said there was nothing available.  Search by the town name, and it will pull them up.  Or at least it did for me :)
===
@IAVaccineAlerts I'm using Walgreen's site and it says there are no appts available for the next five days within 25 miles of Des Moines.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts I actually was using the mobile website, but found that using the desktop worked. I was able to schedule my appointment! Thank you!
===
@eric_lang @GrayDetrick @thedicetower Beth Sobel’s art is amazing!!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Saw the Tweet right after you were back up 3/24. Went right to Walgreens at I've been doing the past week.  Put in zip code,  nothing for 5 days.  Refreshed several times, nothing. On a lark put in Davenport,  bam, more appointments than you could count! Thanks! They need to fix!
===
@3minboardgames Taupo was on my original list, I guess it dropped out when I was editing it!  Yeah, Auckland -&gt; Hamilton -&gt; Tokoroa -&gt; Taupo -&gt; Palmerston North -&gt; Wellington
===
@3minboardgames Taumaranui would have a role in Phase 3, which would branch out from the central spine to cover each side of the North Island.  It'd be a stop in the west extension, the Hamilton -&gt; Taumaranui -&gt; New Plymouth section (maybe a Te Kuiti or Otarahanga stop for the caves?)

@IAVaccineAlerts Love love what you're doing. Is it a little disconcerting to anyone else how difficult it is to get a vaccine in Cedar Rapids? Hopefully things will level out &amp; appointments will be opening up. Thanks for all you do to get so many vaccinated. You're truly a hero.

@thedicetower Time to fire Suzanne. Her bullying of creators like Sarah shah and ant labs should’ve been the last straw. It’s bad optics for the dice tower and we all know it. Time to cut ties. She associates with horrible people in the industry and the sooner the better.

===
@IAVaccineAlerts I got my first today because of your tweets on Monday. Trying to help someone else who is qualified next. We thank you.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts I wish I could share your optimism. I’ve just seen angry, angry people this week. And I’m one of them.
===
@ericghill @IAsatanicschool @shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA We already have a gov that is at least 2 levels above her competence. A sack of rocks could not be worse.

The guy did say no, and I don’t blame him.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Bless you. I am considered high risk and try daily to find one. I am thrilled you have helped people who want them. 👏 Bravo.
===
@Jennerz21 @IAVaccineAlerts Good to know to keep an eye on it for the future.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts 
Thank you so much for doing this-
Just got an appointment for Sunday!!!!!!
===
@heidicullinan @IAVaccineAlerts Also, hopefully people being tentative will come down over time. I know people who just don’t like “new” things like these vaccs. Not conspiracy, just will wait and see and then do it.
===
@heidicullinan @IAVaccineAlerts I watch the Gov pressers each week (for good or bad). There was a Q today about moving vacc around (maybe from some of these areas) to bigger urban (and more likely to take?) areas. We’ll see. Hopefully volumes go up all around soon as Feds have suggested.
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Thank you for your help securing first doses for my family!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Thanks for all your hard work.  I got my first vaccine this week, because of the work of you .  THANK YOU!!!!!!
===
@shfarnsworth @IAVaccineAlerts @KimReynoldsIA Special note: this free, generous act of public service came from a smart person in Iowa City, one of the institutions of higher learning that the legislature and governor disdains so much (except for their sports entertainment).

@LederGames @thedicetower Gotcha - but I thought Fort was a brand new design in 2020 (?) I have a copy, and we play it TONS - my partner Renee’s fave at the moment

@LederGames @thedicetower It’s a re-print??

@williescottb @thedicetower The category is for reprints, re-imaginings, re- a lot of things. ☺️
===
@JewelSub8 @IAVaccineAlerts Thank you
===
I got most of my office signed up with help from @IAVaccineAlerts because they previously didn’t even know where to begin to sign up. We’re all having to travel a little bit but it’s nice to be able to pick where based on what’s available. https://t.co/5knyb4pL4k
===
@BGFeast @thedicetower Thank you so much! :) Couldn't do it without great people like you who help us build awareness of the game!
===
@IAVaccineAlerts Really solid community work. My brother turned me onto the thread and within 4 days, three other siblings and two wives were scheduled. We’ll all be together well before the 4th of July now thanks to this info!

@FlatoutGames @thedicetower Congratulations, well deserved! 😻

@Thone319 @IAVaccineAlerts @shfarnsworth @KimReynoldsIA Check out @RobSandIA. He is fair, honest, empathetic, and holds people accountable. He can absolutely win against @KimReynoldsIA
===
@tambiheiter @IAHouseGOP @IAVaccineAlerts Was just going to say that.

And other amazing citizens donating their time to helping people get appointments. I've seen little done by Iowa.
