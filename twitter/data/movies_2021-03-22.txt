@aaronlauyy I’m halfway after 3 sessions. This whole genre is getting old it’s like the same movie over and over for a decade now. Whoever zack snyder is, ain’t no christopher nolan.

It wasn't until the turn of the century, and the sudden spike in the popularity of the superhero genre on movie screens--more than 20 years after Christopher Reeve resigned the role of Superman--that body transformation became a standard practice for superhero actors.

Watchmen is about a broken humanity and broken humans contrasted against the cold inhumanity(?) of one of thier own. In the hands of a director who was interested in more than a surface glance watchmen could have been one of the greatest genre films ever. But it’s only good.

In Country Comfort, Netflix creates a new genre.  It's called situation-pathetic.  Sit-coms should be funny; this one is Country Uncomfortable.  This may be the worst first episode ever seen.

Significantly, the movie is closer to the war genre than the musical one: the blood on the hands, Andrew’s loneliness, Fletcher’s perversity, the battle of looks, the deafening silence, suggest an underlying violence, scenes and attitudes inherent to war.

@Scottpayne001 @MKMovie I want this genre to get bigger with mainstream. I know it's a hard sell but there's clearly an audience. Pushing an IP like MK has is a game changer. Martial Arts cinema had superheroes. Men and Women fighting, doing their own stunts, no cgi, Guerilla filmmaking on display.

@GauravCFC_ You need context for that. Movie released in 2002, when that time only films of heroic cinematography like khiladi movies, salman movies were released. It was first realistic movie combining both serious and entertainment genre, so yes it was a cult movie.

@Wonggifs I can’t hate a movie where people have some semblance of skill when putting it together, seems a rare thing in genre fare these days. But I’m not sure this amounted to much and it don’t think it really work as a feature lenght.
===
@Poppytrixx I think a lot of men consider “hot chicks” great actresses. Likewise, if your main genre of choice is big budget action films, do you even really know what makes an actress “great”? They should just admit they wanna have sexy times with her &amp; leave it at that. <U+0001F605>

@madblackmother I think Sam was fine in SAS: Red Notice and the movie seemed OK to me (not really my genre), but that scene at the end when his face crumpled up was just proof that he deserves a really juicy dramatic role. I'm sure he is very very happy to be in demand!

Instead, it would muddle the greatness of the preceding joke. Then, in another weird turn, there would be an absence of jokes for another 45 minutes. Then a couple joke and then rinse and repeat. This inconsistency caused the movie to be confusing - emotion- &amp; genre-wise.

I honestly think that The Snyder Cut will go down as one of modern cinema's boldest genre experiments. The same story of every superhero flick ever told on an epic scale and with the heart of an auteur. It's like if Scorsese directed Star Wars.

===
@EdwardGerman3 Same here.  I remember mom dropping me off at the theater to see the pilot/movie.  The part where he finds his parents’ tombstones in post apocalyptic Chicago really fueled my love for the genre.
===
@KirbyAu Not that bad? No, no no, you gotta let this film stew for a few months and have a revisit. I would also recommend you watch other anime films from the 80's, so you can get the full picture of AKIRA's impact on the genre, the medium, and cinema as a whole. AKIRA is a masterpiece.

@sweisraneemm Have you ever watched a movie and there was a song (or music) in it that wasn’t your usual genre yet it fit, and because it fit you liked it?

Watchmen is satire. It's critiquing its own genre. Snyder just put comic to movie screen, and highlighted the parts he liked. But what gets highlighted affects how the movie is received. So even tho the source material is a critique, the movie is a homage to what's critiqued.

@glazedribeye @GameSpot I disagree with some things here. Saying marvel movies aren't cinema is a very general, absolute statement. They are cinema. They're just their own genre. Justice League is just a different style than Marvel movies, which I think is why people are saying it's "unwatchable"

Movie Genre for tonight’s selections: Romance<U+0001F940>

In case its not clear, my point is that studios funneling more and more money into fewer and fewer projects is really what's crippling American cinema. Superhero movies are only the trend that was popular when this happened, but it could've happened with any genre.

Started to watch the justice league and it reminded me I’m not really into movie adaptations of comic books anymore. Wandavision is the exception. I think Hollywood has played that genre out with the million movies &amp; shows in the last decade or so.

@JBizzle703 @RichPointofView Yeah its not hard to see that DC sucks overall at movie making, and Marvel is damn good at it. And I'm not a big comic book/movie guy.

But, The Dark Knight is easily the greatest movie in the genre's history. It really is one the best flicks ever made.

yes, it really entertained me. hm, i love “A Walk to Remember”, so far. how 'bout you? do you have any favorite movie from comedy genre? https://t.co/KXZRql7HmC

#ZackSnydersJusticeLeague is light years beyond what Joss Whedon and Warner Bros. sent to theaters.

When taken into context alongside Man of Steel and BvS, I think Zack Snyder can stand alongside the Russo Bros. as one of the premiere directors in the Superhero film genre.

Hands down! @AlanTudyk is best actor! @ResidentAlien is my all time favorite tv show. ...in any genre. #brilliantTV #aliens
===
@scottrenshaw @FrankYan2 Yeah, exactly. But also there's none of the usual disaster movie tropes so it definitely doesn't feel like that genre.
===
@Dave_the_Turnip @wordpressdotcom I like this perspective. I myself have fallen under that trap as well. How can you be sure if you love something if you haven't played every game that director/company has produced, or everything in the genre? It's good to just enjoy what you have sometimes.

@DMan1954Gojira and i’m glad it isn’t. the kaiju genre shouldn’t be like other movie genres. some people just don’t really understand this movie genre and that sucks for them because they’ll never be able to enjoy a kaiju film since they always have other genre expectations in mind

i do like that realistic fantasy (I am forgetting the word for this genre I think) more than horror ultimately.... snowpiercer is a great movie

@DoctorLongscarf 'The Dark Knight' is just a Batman movie (albeit a reality-grounded one). As much  as I love it, it doesn't advance the genre. 'The Winter Soldier' is a political thriller using comic book characters. That was doing something interesting and unique.

The way Ayºe's poetic monologues synchronized with Demet's style of delivering the extracts from Sanem's book was a genre of its own. Queens of ART and Literature. Never seen a writer-actress duo  generating that kind of power.
===
@itswilltime I agree, it's interesting to watch a different take on the genre. Marvel's formula has grown pretty long in the tooth. I hope WB/DC does what they've promised with The Flash movie and shakes up the continuity so they have another chance to get it right.

.@JimCameron’s landmark #scifi movie, #ALIENS; a film that is widely considered not just one of the best films of the sci-fi genre, but often mentioned as one of the best films of the #1980s and is also the film that brought #StanWinston's first @TheAcademy Award win in 1986. https://t.co/6oGmxm2uC3

If you want your favorite show, game, movie, etc. to sound good just call it a deconstruction of the genre

For example, Final Fantasy XIV is a deconstruction of mmos, Chainsaw Man is a deconstruction of battle shonen, The Boss Baby is a deconstruction of children's animation
===
be characters and that's why a lot of Mecha's don't do it for me in the genre because they tend to be like Heisei Godzilla, glorified vehicles.

Kiryu shatters this issue by deploying some admittedly bizzare concepts that I still think work in the movie's context.

===
@mattzollerseitz @ponderer The problem with superhero movies is we began already ensconced in the post-Leone/Peckinpah deconstruction era having never had a Ford/Hawks/Mann golden age, so every movie is about how the genre is already moribund. I guess we're at the BIG JAKE/CAHILL/THE COWBOYS phase

There is no dynamic where the #SnydersCut is anything more than an average movie. 

From what I remember of the original edit, this one is an improvement, but it's average. And that's fine, but we don't need to pretend it defines a genre, etc. It's okay.

In summary:
* BREAKING DAWN PART 2 has a better climax fight than ENDGAME
* AUSTIN POWERS IN GOLDMEMBER was arguably more of a negative turning point for the parody genre than EPIC MOVIE
* An octopus told Dr Dolittle “snitches get stitches”
* I will totally see AFTER WE COLLIDED

This “The Platform” movie is the exact genre of movie I like. Every single second is interesting and fascinating to me

@ZackSnyder @hbomax I just watched your movie and loved every bit of it.

@BossyBr00ke @Sheena_655321 I think it’s ok that I listed it. IMDb says thriller, which is a sub-genre of horror. I get that it’s a love story, but it has horror elements. Other articles say, “...genre bending”, so I think I’m good. :)
===
@maldonsaltt Moulin Rouge, movie directed by Baz Luhrmann. Definitely a sub genre of ppl &amp; almost fringe theatre kids. The musical is either revered and referred to as “genius,” or received as an affront to the genre as a whole. There is no in-between.
===
After watching The Dark Knight for what is the billionth time by now I know why it's the greatest superhero movie to date.

Evert other movie of the same genre since has tried to be a different version of it...including it's own sequel.

@DCEUCraig @Nexahs @SlightlyCuti Zack is a director and a creator. Every director deserves to have their vision preserved. When a studio and creative agree to make a movie that's their right. It applies to every genre and film. Film is art. Let the directors be artists.
===
@Animated_Antic I’d say, if you’re making a certain film, genre, setting, etc. you need to choose music that matches the mood, or vibe of the trailer, which should at least have a feeling that matches whatever tone you’re trying to give the movie!
===
@MattHemley Playing devil's advocate, isn't exposure and coverage of the genre on prime time television something to be celebrated?! I completely understand why it may feel inappropriate but with theatre about to kick off again, it might be the passion ignitiation people need to buy tickets!
===
My favorite movie genre is campy comedies of the late 80s/early 90s
===
.  I think the Justice League movie is proof Zack Snyder can put a great spin on live action Dc Comics franchise, in my opinion it's a quality mature content of the comic book movie genre adults can appreciate.
===
Its probably not an easy thing making a profit for a comic book film with a mature rating especially if the movie is not a huge joke such as deadpool but that's Zack Snyder's category of the comic book movie genre.

@edroso ALSO, Booksmart just came out two years ago, but girls were at the center of that movie, but it’s straight up raunchy teen comedy. It’s so tiring — what do they want? To have a specific genre to bitch about?

@FILMREN Actually the use of color correction is not about racism but about focusing on the genre and the theme of the movie. If the cc is warm the movie is probably action, crime story; if it's cold the movie will probably focus on a more intimistic dimension

I’m two hours into @snydercut and holy shit. @ZackSnyder please please don’t leave this genre. MoS was a masterpiece and so far this is on track to be another. We want and need (tho I don’t know if we deserve) another Snyder/Cavill Superman movie.
===
@nihilisticbeast @cactus_hate_you It doesn't matter what kind of genre it is with horror for me. They all make me freak out on a certain level. I actually can deal with splatter far better than with psychological things. Which goes basically for every movie genre out there.

@CaseyLurtz @JamusLynch I hear that! It definitely is bad by 2021 standards.

@fanofredwings04 @HungerforHorror @Sheena_655321 What does "predictable" even mean, tho?

my favorite movie genre is scarlett johansson hitting sam rockwell
===
@filmobjective Yeah. I've said that it doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it's just another example of Scorsese being able to do any genre of movie.
===
@almaazul75 <U+0001F49C> Interesting movie, Alma. Quite experimental in tackling the “horror” genre.
===
@RochardScott RDJ, due to no fault of his, hits a flatline. The character loses dynamism and stays in the safe space of genre, tropes, IP comfort zone. That goes on to limit what the actor can do. Wolverine's X-Men-X-2-Logan arc gives Jackman more dynamism to work with.
===
“‘Enfant Terrible’ is one of the more successful examples of a director biopic, but the familiar conventions of the genre eventually do a disservice to such a talented filmmaker.”

This was a four hour tonal clusterfuck that brought nothing new to the incredibly overexposed superhero genre. Almost all of the scenes had been done before by another film and in every instance another film did it better than this movie. #SnyderCut
===
@chifomusic100 @MacConwell Genre's due to the multi-verse will be a little scrambled.  Fantasy with Elves, Magic, etc... with some near modern / sci-fi elements as well.

We have the first three seasons of the animation outlined already, as well as the first movie that will follow the first season.

@YNWAlfcnews_ Despite comedy isn't my first genre but not easy to name a specific one. Generally: <U+0001F447>
-Jack Lemmon's works (Avanti, The Apartment etc..)
-Mel Brooks' (Blazing Saddles, Silent Movie etc..)
-De Niro's (Analyze this and that, Showtime etc..)

favourite movie genre? — thriller/horror. https://t.co/4yr33VoJav
===
Ross Douthat writing a "bring back the romantic comedy" take in the NYT proves me right that it's a reactionary position; the romantic comedy as formulated in the 1990s and 2000s was the death spiral of a genre that had been one of the engines of Hollywood since silent cinema
===
@Wemusthaveknown I do not enjoy the genre my favorite horror movie is army of darkness
===
@bitterkarella it had a number of fresh, solid ideas, but it lacked direction. if production had been straightened out and the movie rejiggered for a slightly older audience, with the darker elements not being compromised, it could've been a genre classic.

@Siwonest_SJ7 the genre is melodrama though, just prepare your heart and some tissues I guess <U+0001F602> it's an old movie but still a good one even if you watch it now, just like its title, class@ic

i generally think the snyders cut wasn't anything special. i do agree it's definitely more complete and whole and a great movie but no, it isn't genre bending or anything. it's just a great dc movie. imo IW &amp; endgame trump it. but maybe if they'd given snyder the opportunity

@WillamKelley @DalGreer @TheJannissary Not sure why everyone is arguing this. Snyder did a cool death scene with WW. Hasn’t been done in the comic movie genre much whatsoever. Only a handful of times max. It was cool. He’s not a genius for it, but it’s awesome he put it in the movie. End of argument <U+0001F644>

@YNWAlfcnews_ Come and see. It isn't even in the horror genre, but it's a terrifying movie.
===
@MandoBatSpidey It was a homage to the Lynda Carter Wonder Woman series, the Christopher Reeve Superman movies and the first Supergirl movie. It succeeded in homaging this genre and evoking this era.
===
Imagine being a director with a vision for a vast epic that squashed overused genre conventions that had to step down from said production due to personal tragedy and then had a lion’s share of his footage reshoot by someone else with a running time cut down 50% for wide release https://t.co/4Y7wKHVaV3

But more surprising were Masha's findings about the circulation of non-political (e.g. genre) cinema from Mexico and Argentina, which was very popular and profitable in the USSR. The ideological accommodation of this was fascinating.

@Nexahs @SlightlyCuti And??? Wes was ONE example, there’s lots more

There’s no rule that states comic book movies need to be filmed in one ratio with that being widescreen, that’s ignorance

@CaptAmazo It reminds me a lot of how people view western as a genre...some really view all westerns through the lens of “it was a simpler better time and it’s how we built America, gosh darn it” even after it was apparent not every director and writer saw The West like Stagecoach does
===
@Chriss_m &gt;Your mind and senses should be ready for a challenge.

Few non-fictional, non-supernatural, non-superpower movies do this. This guy is just pretentious. A good movie is a good movie, regardless of setting and genre, but due to the characters, their interactions and struggle.
===
@briannakaymree Omg it is the fucking scariest. I legit stoped watching scary movies until like the last couple years because the fourth kind freaked me out so bad in theaters!!! Turns out it’s my favorite genre I just really HATED that movie
===
@symatt For example, if you are playing a horror game which is set up to mirror a typical horror novel or movie, then the characters should be going into the cellar alone or opening the strange box - that isn’t meta gaming because it is the player following the genre

Haven't watched 'em yet <U+0001F605>
===
@jobosonchisa If the movie could not be cut down to a normal runtime for its genre (~120 minutes) it was a bad movie right off the bat. Zack Snyder’s “vision” could only work in a panini when everyone is binging TV at home. Even then it’s kind of a slog to get through.

@IvanTheK While long, the Snyder cut made Justice League a really good movie (for the genre), cool ads coming I hope

===
It's been so long since I went into a movie this completely blind. I don't even know what frickin /genre/ outside near future sci-fi. But 15 mins in and I'm getting some distinct horror vibes, so we'll see if that pans out.

@Ryffnah It was definitely a new twist on the haunted house tale. That's not really my genre (ghosts), but I always loved Matthew Lillard in the movie =]

I should totally do a Matthew Lillard movie weekend. You in, @BirminghamGlenn?

Again, I can't stop thinking about this. "Sitcom is a specialized genre" lmao the absolute gall! Ah yes, so many hallowed genres; Brechtian representation, raw cinéma vérité, Spielberg's epics, Larry David's gold standard improv, a multi-cam CBS sitcom... https://t.co/7qmawG2ski

movie rules. Nick Nolte rules, Eddie Murphy is an instant star, and it's easy to tell how this kick started an entire genre of film.

but for as many buddy cop movies as would follow, i've never seen one replicate just how much these leads hate each other. "buddy" is a stretch
===
nw: 48 Hours (1982)

about time i checked out the first(?) buddy cop movie. weird to think that genre started as late as the 80s https://t.co/h1FPOBDzHl

@gay_phenom This tweet is a part of a genre of tweets about Zack Snyder’s Justice League that would be a great elevator pitch for a much better Justice League movie

Honestly I would love a hyper slow motion scene in every single movie regardless of genre.

I think the army storming a building counts as genre bending.I'm old enough to remember when this movie was mostly just hanging out in belly dancing bars and smoking cigarettes. #SpaceApeCinema
===
Lots of great scenes with Cyborg and Flash that should have been kept in the theatrical cut. I still enjoy some of the comedy from the Joss Whedon version, action comedy is my favorite genre. Crazy how different the two versions of the movie are.

Today, our movie choices are limited to the repetitive super hero genre or woke, social justice films. https://t.co/piFK2jX5Pb

When y'all said 2020 was gonna be a movie....what genre did y'all mean exactly...... https://t.co/al7d3rgGvX
===
I watched this movie Z (2019) which was fine, had a few decent parts, but it got me thinking about the mercurial nature of elevated horror as a niche genre specifically how few Babadook knock-offs we tend to get?
===
Justice League Snyder Cut thread: The movie is immeasurably better, and frankly, a completely different movie. If you're a fan of the genre, it is absolutely worth a watch.

If you're not a fan, it's probably not as general-public friendly as say, Iron Man or Black Panther. (1/n)
===
I don't think there has ever been a movie like #TheSnyderCut Justice League. A completely unfiltered vision of a filmmaker who is unique in the superhero genre. I'm glad it exists, and I love it...
===
Been watching a lot of 80s movies since the plague started and like..was peeping just a thing we were super ok with in the 80s?  I swear it's in every single movie, regardless of genre..and it's often a "hero" character that's doing it.
===
Is psychological drama a movie genre bc if so this is it
===
I only have a fav movie in the romantic comedy genre which is "the proposal" https://t.co/aReTrh1zbX
===
@robkroese You can still enjoy it but it's just not worthy of discussion. I also doubt anything interesting and new can be done with the genre. I think Snyders Watchmen was the best super movie.
===
Salman bhoi fans trolling #MumbaiSaga collections - it is bad phase release and genre is limited so itna uchalo mat - Satyamev Jayate 2 is pan india mass movie and bad phase rahega to bhoi ke bhi l lag hi jaayenge <U+0001F923>
===
There was a European Cinema class (which I took and loved) and a class covering pretty much every genre. And look I know you can't cover everything but Asian Cinema has been pretty influential. So many Western remakes.
===
@JaneNightshade Blood Simple was horror genre, wasn't it? https://t.co/rY0ElEYyyY
===
That's because Marvel's quality has been more consistent. They are the Pixar of the comic book movie genre. Snyder fans know this. They are deeply envious because they know this. https://t.co/muQhDLLOZ1
===
All his bizarre instincts are perfect for that one specific genre. He’s basically already made a Shadowhawk movie, he just had to file the serial numbers off and use this “Batman” character as a standin
===
@oconnor_dennis Ah gas film. Haven’t seen it in 20 years. It’s top class. It’s up there with Intermission and Perrier’s Bounty for Irish films of that genre. Love it. 

Cinema in the Square, there’s a blast from the past.
===
I genuinely can't tell what genre this movie is https://t.co/RXgiFHYY3K
===
@WrongReel @DavidLambertArt @qyou185 The background info is interesting and it gives me a whole other way to look at a movie and a genre like westerns, even one like The Searchers that I've seen a bunch. Love Wrong Reel. <U+0001F44D>
===
@isaacradcliffe2 @youcancalmealex But more importantly, he was trying to set the stage for Dc or at least the JL sequels to be epics in the super hero movie genre.

Anyone can spoof one genre. But making one movie that parodies both WW2 movies and Elvis movies? Genius. https://t.co/G2sAJVn85H
===
the funniest part of the whole whedon vs snyder thing is that on top of being mediocre directors, the movie they nominally went head to head on is part of the B-tier franchise in a genre that is shit practically by definition. in that context, what does winning even mean
===
I like anime, but I just watched Kimi no Nawa, with the Attack on Titan series
I like Drakor, even I can't count because I have watched lots of titles.
I like watching western films, the action genre is my mainstay, even more or less  I have watched 250 movie titles. Proud to me
===
@boomborks These people missing that Snyder has gone on record that this whole movie was holding a mirror to the genre while condemning the film so smugly is just the best.
===
Just watched Freaky with the fam. We enjoyed it. It’s a gory horror film that’s also a comedy that pokes fun at the genre. The Common Sense Media review is spot on.

hey moots, what's your favorite movie genre and movie?

MCU stans are absolutely awful for the comic movie genre.

What’s your favorite movie genre?

Watching the Synder Cut, which is a superhero movie a oversaturated genre, by a boring director with drab visuals. https://t.co/jSUJmWrsi4
===
@FilmCompanion @Vishal1Menon Thanks for the interview. The critics of this movie need to read/listen to some interviews from Director, producer and Naveen. They perfectly put forward what they intended and stayed true to the genre

<U+27A1><U+FE0F> Facts.

<U+2744> Winter drinks a lot of milk.
<U+2744> Her favorite film genre is action.
<U+2744> She likes eating chocolate and sweets.
<U+2744> She has a dimple on her left cheek.
<U+2744> She intended to become an actress, but she liked to sing and dance so she decided to become an idol.

but we’ve also lost things like more standard comedy movie like most of will farrell’s filmography, or the entire genre of b-movies

Tender appreciation for social media whenever a new project hits the pavement, no matter the love/hate expressed for the PROJECT, DIRECTOR, GENRE or STUDIO. The communal chatter makes my heart sing. *Awed by the way stories unify us (for or against) we still got to ride together.

Superman: The Movie (1978)

Everything from the tone and structure to the effects and story feel very dated. But in a weird way it’s also pretty timeless and still extraordinarily influential on the comic book movie genre today. A massively fun and delightful origin story.

4/5 https://t.co/qmxWFE7viT
===
I just watched a movie that aged incredibly well for the first time. 

Coming to America (1988). 

Correct me if I'm wrong but I think this movie is solely responsible for starting the modern black comedy genre. It started Eddie Murphys multiple people gag, among others.
===
@cyrilicioushawk @theFLICKpick I’m glad they’re different. If all these movies were a similar style, they would grow old quickly. If anybody thinks movie genre popularity doesn’t die away, ask fans of westerns.
===
@SATURNZ_V @LeslieLee327 If you're looking for a decent movie on Netflix, may I suggest "Hospital". In the Asian horror genre and oh my god FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC!!!! #iscreamed #canuguesswhichpart

@rezaaslan sitcoms are “very tough to play”, just look at noted very good actor jerry seinfeld. 
jesus fucking christ, “specialized genre”, they gave blossom a show as a car cafe owner and her name’s ‘kat’. youre not pt anderson
===
when i say my playlist vary from genre it does it literally goes from alternative rock music to the soundtrack of a fucking movie
===
..of it, starring with Clark Gable who was checking out ASAP and largely unawares. The after-party / hangover aspect of the movie as a post "death of the west" genre piece and suddenly those movies make more sense when you realize folks are waking up to a future of capturing...
===
Not a fan of the "Exposition Dragon". This movie was good enough satire without her pointing out every single example of going against the genre. Plus she goes out like a wimp.
===
What movie can you watch over and over without ever getting tired of? — sscc hm i reallyyy do love watching movies especially those with fantasy genre but i rarely rewatch them but maybe its Harry Potter series!! Also usually thos… https://t.co/k5hxmDfUwV

stupid american cube movie is like a genre https://t.co/1HiOloonGz
===
@mikekorz I think it’s underrated in the sense that it should talked about more as a GOAT movie regardless of genre
===
Long story short, it was a bush. I was scared by a shrub. And so began my love of the horror genre as I vowed never to be terrified by my garden ever again.

And that's how I became a horror movie fan. So thank you to @MuseWatson for scaring me all those years ago.
===
@ChampagneDosser I'm an adult geek. I will love this genre of movie till I die. 
Joss whedons cut was appalling. #SnyderCutJusticeLeague will be firmly in the older kid/adult geek for life bracket. Probably not for generic film goers though. 4hrs is utter geekdom
===
Dislike a movie all you want but nothing 'should be' the way you want it regardless of the movie being good. This 'every superhero movie should be like this' isn't a healthy way to approach a genre. https://t.co/xUYNsqoQaG
===
@THR I feel TDKR was so underrated. While it has 78 Metacritic score with 10 medias gave 100 (Only TDK has more) and being no.4 in superhero genre in IMDB top 250(after TDK, Joker and Avengers: Infinity War), I feel people always try to rank it lower just because it's a sequel of TDK.
===
@theFLICKpick Just too hard to say this movie didn’t simple shatter the superhero movie genre into something more meaningful
