Quarto is an amazing 2-player game.

Players take turns placing 16 different pieces on a board. The one who completes a row of 4 "similar" pieces wins.

Sounds meh, no?

@Skyswipe I’m aware, but I think it’s still worth noting the bad game-feel of watching a long board combo if you didn’t draw your hand trap, and likewise how frustrating having to add in the hand-traps can be in terms of impact on your own setup consistency.

@Cipher_db That's what hand traps are for. Even if you can't stop your opponents combos, there is always a way to break the board. You just need to be familiar with what those outs are. The game isn't as cut and dry. The meta right now is back and forth. Duels do last more than 5 turns.

@CollinAshby @RickCarpiniello This is an awful quote. NHL officiating is bad, but imo the nhl officials have less of an impact on the game than any other sport, simply because an nhl official can’t put points on/off the board. NBA . NFL, mlb can put points on the board, but in hockey you can kill a penalty.

1990 Oil Spill board game.

I almost hope it goes through and we suddenly seen games getting banned (e.g from Steam) en masse. Would be quite the drama to watch and maybe the Gov will get some brains

@Dozibugger Lots to be taken from board games and RPGs. My Sengoku battle rules take the command system from a board game, the battle campaign is run by a board game, and my solo skirmish campaign approach was heavily influenced by the White Wolf role playing games.
===
@Dozibugger @ReggieRaccoonOK @tomjmegan @frazermac @SvelhlauprDavid Possibly board game counters record more information. E.g. fight value and move distance. You can add up fight value and apply to a CRT. With figures, you wouldn't want to look up the values first and then apply to a CRT 1/2
===
@Dozibugger @TheByzantineGuy @tomjmegan @frazermac @SvelhlauprDavid Yes, I think painted miniatures can capture the imagination in a way that a board game can't. Even if that contributes next to nothing to the actual modelling, it still has 'value.'
===
@JTubesocks @tha_rami @Fletxaoscura @centristvoltron Play the games mentioned earlier or Frostpunk or Hellblade and tell me their stories would work better as movies.

@RadMrBlock @kwichiii that board game "Connect Four" is also called "Vier Gewinnt" in german.

4 in austria is like a D or D- in the US

Playing the longest board game version of monopoly! How can you make the best game ever(in my opinion) better? Make it longer.

@MUWarriorRN @HelenKennedy @atrupar Yep. He thoroughly creeped me out, and I never voluntarily saw a second of “The Apprentice.” Back in the 2000’s, I spotted a ratty used “Trump The Game” board game in a Goodwill store for a dollar, and I laughed, thinking “who would waste money on that loser?” Still wondering.

@Dozibugger @jaje7406 @sprandell @tomjmegan @frazermac @SvelhlauprDavid In some ways board games represent the origin of the modern trend to "everything in one box" so beloved of the "bane on the hobby companies." However, if you compare to the cost and time involved in putting together a figure game, they probably represent a decent investment

@geekygaymerguy @FuntailsGames It's very simple. https://t.co/Z9YhuIXYj3 is specifically for background music while playing a board game. It's essentially a YT playlist.

@SvelhlauprDavid @tomjmegan @frazermac 👍🏼 it’s a visual hobby. That’s one of the things that draws people in. And I also know that I can take one look at a board game and make a completely unfounded decision about whether I want to play it or not, purely based on a visual appeal. It’s the same with food, of course.

@jaje7406 @DavidJackson97 I buy board games with the intention of playing the game as written, and I try to. But I often think ‘ooh, these counters and maps are fab, what else can I do with these”!
===
@jaje7406 @sprandell @tomjmegan @ReggieRaccoonOK @frazermac @SvelhlauprDavid I have a few GMT games. Each one needs a good chunk of time and focus. But probably no more than an equivalently immersive figure game. And we often moan about set up time for board games, but will easily spend the same time setting up our battlefields.
===
@tomjmegan @frazermac @SvelhlauprDavid We must remember, that the figures that we paint are really nothing more than blocks. Look at Kriegsspiel, which I still view as the pinnacle of a hobby. Is it more than a board game?

@Moiterei1984 @Dozibugger @SvelhlauprDavid @tomjmegan @GoatMajor I think my point was not to replicate what board games do, but try and think how you might represent information that board games commonly represent to the player within a figure game. My personal opinion is that "smart tables" might be something worth investigating

@Dozibugger In a boardgame all the tokens, cards, etc are “the game”. I don’t see them as accessories because aesthetically they all fit together. It’s a board game. Converse for miniatures, the table is the game. Cards and chits don’t ‘belong’ there even if they provide crucial mechanics.

@Dozibugger @ReggieRaccoonOK @tomjmegan @frazermac @SvelhlauprDavid Mechanics that really make the theme shine. More and more I want my miniatures games and board games to be tightly focused on unique mechanics. I don’t want a generic skirmish game with a Roman skin or a cowboy skin or a sci-do skin etc.

Well Sri Lanka have certainly turned this game, they're now 469-9 in their 2nd inning, with a lead of 367 on the board. They'll likely have a day and change to bowl out the West Indies. Nissanka hit a lovely century and Dickwella was out for 96. #WIvsSL

Playing a board game with family:

10yo: “Wanna know my strategy in this game?”

*leans towards me and whispers*

“L-U-C-K.”
===
Now we come to the board, and this is printed on the back of it. Definitely lets you know the style of game you're getting into.

As an aside, can we add 'let's do this' to the end of *our* oath of office? Asking for a friend. https://t.co/9agEGwyInj
===
Additionally, the last third of the book mostly just explains the various Kickstarter additions to the game you can use or not, such as the aforementioned chaoa board.

All in all it's not nearly as intimidating as you think when you hear '40-page rulebook'.
===
Wait, another board?

Had to check, but this is apparently a 'chaos' board for variant play that adds additional voter unpredictability into the course of the game.

Democracy is messy. So why not take it to 11 apparently? https://t.co/ZmoFXbFkuD

@steveretka I remember a party at an acquaintance's place, where everyone was ostensibly leftist. One announced they brought it, saw my withering glare, went 'oh shit, you're that board game friend', and slunk away. They're perfectly aware of what it is, what it does, and the audience.

@medhawrites @DanHusain The board’s been set

the players must find each other

the smoke screams out to the world 
Here I was once blazing

@Dozibugger Yes. A board game is self-contained. A tabletop game is not and its pieces usually have much wider utility in other games of its period (folk will look at you funny if you start setting up Wellington's Battle using Waterloo's counters - and the game won't work).
===
@Dozibugger @tomjmegan @frazermac While I take your point @Dozibugger, and you're not wrong in principle, in practice the aesthetics of a tabletop game are an important, if sometimes nebulous factor, and no boardgame - however lovely (and some are lovely) have that kind of aesthetic.
===
@ReggieRaccoonOK @Dozibugger @tomjmegan @frazermac There's increasing 'crossover'. But it's like erotica and porn - you should know the difference when you see it . . . (and I grant you, part of that is a 'board' versus tabletop terrain, which is aesthetic. But how many boardgames use ruler-based movement? Not many.

@SandyPugGames the most important thing I've learned from having written a ton of TTRPGs and Board Game rulesets is that TTRPGs have the luxury of having a voice!
A board game needs to convey its rules differently than an rpg, which exists more as a conversation, suggestion, and guide

To clarify, there are only two board game YouTube channels that I really actively care about. SU&amp;SD, because even if it’s a game they dislike, they -usually- still give useful pros and cons, and Rodney from Watch it Played. Bless Rodney. Bless his pure soul.

can I afford that board game hngggg i can.. but I've also been wanting to buy a nicer backpack with padded straps that has a nice structure ....

There's a roller derby board game in my head using modified mechanics from Flamme Rouge and at some point I'm gonna crack it and then never make a prototype or do anything about it.

Transformers beast wars had a board game? https://t.co/mhtEmwAPQF

@AGretz This is always exhibit A for me when opining the NHL Board of Governors  are the ones responsible for the state of the game. Despite his title, Gary Bettman's job to to keep that group happy and take arrows for them, not look out for the best interests of the game.

@fichuntie board game went and tried to give him a tiddy reduction. that's a damn shame 😔

Until Tanizaki calls them all to eat the crepes he made. Tea time, Ranpo is R E A D Y.

On the other side of the city, the Mafia puts the game board away and also gathers to eat some cake. A cake Tachihara made with Gin. They love cooking on lazy days.

I probably said this ages ago, but it bears repeating: fighting game devs need to properly teach players how to play their own games. The players should not be explaining the rules.

Imagine buying a board game and not being given the rules on how to play.

@Briccyardlilyo Can’t blame him for this, I look forward to watching his pro career 💙  I hope Armando stays, next year could be a breakout year for him. With Kessler and Day’Ron gone, this is his chance to take his game to the next level and get himself on the draft board for 2022.

There is a special circle of hell reserved for having a middle schooler explain to you the rules of a board game.

@israperrillo @io_shei @llama_dice @devirgames  I don't know if you guys listen to USA board game podcasts but @DiceAndNames podcast gave Red Cathedral an award for best of in 2020. They have a lot of listeners! Starts at 53:03 for Red Cathedral. https://t.co/USQTYCbU37

@robdaviau Place the game board over the table of contents.

If your new game shows up with a full-page errata sheet attached to the outside cover, with errors on not just the rulebook but the board, player aids, counters, you have utterly failed. Do better GMT. And this is just what's been caught so far. https://t.co/Ll2FSnFIon

@ZambiesDecays I would say the Blues.  There's also a board game that came out recently that has hockey miniatures https://t.co/1TKvBBi9BL

Full disclosure though…the new options are awful and non sensical. They aren’t really fitting for the game. But I’m here for ALL the irrational agitation about “Woke-ness” over silly things like a board game. Especially since no one was trying to “cancel” Monopoly.

@elongreen I just realized I could do this too because I filmed two videos for the Globe and Mail in 2016 that are available on YouTube, one of them a group review of the deeply confusing Donald Trump board game

For Opening Day, April 1, BART will offer a one-time-only special service plan: One train per BART route will be standing by once the game ends (Berryessa, Dublin, Millbrae, Richmond-Antioch riders should board Richmond train and transfer to an Antioch train at MacArthur)

@RRollplaying Make believe with rules. 
Team building exercise. 
Cooperative board game meets episodic TV.

@TylerHuckabee @thecachinnator You can't make a board game, write all the rules, name the venue, then pretend work is being had between the players.

I never signed on for the "woke" term, they did. And now it's a junk drawer for them to dump everything they don't like.
===
@thatkkidalex @thisisnotjoshua @IrvingsGoat @TheNBACentral Kobe has scored more points in a game than harden down the board tho. Why bring up Jeremy Lin ? Lol Kobe was doing this when defense mattered as well, harden got it easy

Adventure Tactics (2/3)
I'm pleased that this game introduces dungeon-crawl play at an introductory-level. My son is only so-so on playing board games, but is enjoying the story-telling, decision-making, characters, &amp; cooperative play. 1 W, 1L but failing-forward, which is great.

@sideropsychos Levi just raised a brow at him. He forgot how good of a memory Erwin has. He sat down in front of Erwin, chess board laid out in front of them.

"Of course you didn't forget about challenging me to a game of chess."

@brightsider123 A board game piece? I'd like to see more pictures of it.
