I actually liked the writing style of fatpie in wattpad, although I don't focus on the main plot of his story, the way he wrote so many things all in one chapter and how he improved by each chapters made me feel really happy somehow. I don't even know him, but I am happy for him.

ʿʿSpanish football is very good technically and tactically. If English teams are beating us it's not because we aren't as strong but because we are not doing well on the ball. If a Spanish team is sharp on the ball it can beat anyoneʾʾ

@Moley_LFC No sympathy in terms of how he lost his dream job. He was a very wealthy man. Who could have retired at that point and lived very well. But he choose greed. And was caught, so only himself to blame. Not a bad manager, but comes across as abit of a twat in my opinion.

@RBiakpara When he said his mom said he must learn it well or quit after landing on his neck, I felt it, I knew nigerian women don't do that.

@ruth_hw It is! The best bit is that you just plonk the hive somewhere suitable and then you have two/three months of happy bumbles bumbling and pollinating. The colony dies off naturally when the new queen finds somewhere in the local area, so the good hopefully is longer term.

Has @harmonyprotocol considered auto staking of rewards? I love the staking process, the ease, the very low fees, but auto-staking (re-staking rewards) would be a good option as well. It would promote a 'set and forget' mentality (stability) rather than constantly fiddling.

@lt_havers Sorry I misread your tone I'm not the best at reading tone. I get not wanting to judge something till you see the end product but what I didn't like was ppl being mad at ppl for instantly disliking it and going with their gut feeling on it. Hope you have a good day as well :)

@s_phillips8 I rated Scholes higher. Gerrard was always too selfish, happy to shoot from 30+ yards rather than play in a striker. Great when they went in but less so when they didn’t. I’d agree he had the best all-round game of the three usually mentioned though. Scholes couldn’t tackle.

@AndyR_OAFC @shah_arooj @OldhamCouncil @JimfromOldham Well last summer it took months of moaning to Jim Mc. Including photo evidence posted to the Labour HQ in town.

Life brings us as many joyful moments as it does downfalls, and although there are days we wish there was a guide to follow, it simply wouldn’t be the same without the spontaneity. The journey of life may not become easier as we grow older, but we do seem to know it better

@NigeriaStories @Mrceo_77 The fact remains that the government is not looking for terrorists, rather fighting and thinking that they could eliminate the INDIGENOUS PEOPLE by oppressing and  killing them. YOU CAN NEVER KILL EVERYONE. NOTE IT WELL.
