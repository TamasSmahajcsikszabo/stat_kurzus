Mayo Clinic does not specify brands  of vaccines but they agree that “If you get a nonreplicating, inactivated or mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccine, you can donate blood without a waiting period.” 

Which means that Covishield (AstraZeneca) at least gets the all-clear.

@kare11 So for any sport that requires a helmet, this is basically no change. Kids aren’t going to take off a helmet to put on a mask on the sidelines and then take it off to go back into the game. It would be nice if MDH could use some common sense.

@deetweetathon @JJVHouse Thanks for info. I did not know, to assure vaccine availability, Supreme Court passed National CHILDHOOD Vaccine Injury Act (NCVIA) in '86. I need to research further. Eg. Does that ALSO apply to Covid-19?
Not "childhood" vax). But, do people KNOW can't sue for adverse reactions?

@konabud4 @DarqenDuck @ksorbs So calling covid-19 the China virus or Kung flu is supposed to be a jab at the Chinese government? ...ok.
The CCP isn't like the Democrats, since they are communists and the Democrats aren't. Calling the virus those racist names just brings hate and prejudice onto Chinese people.

@johnculvenor @ScottMorrisonMP Yep, like the flu mutates and 'they' recommend a new and revised flu shot every year because the old one is redundant. Same will happen with the covid vaccine. And the covid vaccines are one big experiment. So I say 'no thanks' and 'yes please' to shut international borders.

please wear a mask, sanitise your houses by keeping it as clean as possible and yourself too. this is not a joke, many lives are lost, it's a long list. you don't wanna be making it longer. stay safe and please go outside only if necessary.
===
Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.

Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.

Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.

Don’t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.

Cover your nose and mouth

I live in the bluest section of a blue city in a blue state and have never worn a mask outside.

It did seem far too good to be true. India’s double variant is in the UK and is surely likely to be very, very bad for us. But sure, let’s keep on opening up and sticking banners on TV shows telling us the pandemic’s done. https://t.co/t58TpFVtDZ

The reason why I wear this mask is to hide the shame and embarrassment as an failure. 
I am a monster who hurts everybody for existing.
I just wanna live, but I can’t save myself from this selfish horrible being I am.
I don’t deserve this life.
There’s no second chances to reset.

@Ritika_44 @PMOIndia @narendramodi @AmitShah @RahulGandhi @ManmohanVaidya @PravinSinghal92 @Lucky_meena93 @im_AshokMeena @PragpuraPilot @BabuLalPanchol3 Shame on Indian Government. Over to that they charge 1000 rs. for not wearing mask. Then too they can’t manage oxygen supply. Ek haath mein paani lo aur naak dubao usme.

There are better days to come, if we keep taking action to stop the spread of COVID-19. Call your GP if you notice any symptoms. Keep washing your hands, wear a face covering &amp; keep your distance when around others. We can do this. #HoldFirm
