Do you improv or add your own stories in the board games you play?

Above and Below is a game with a storybook giving you choices, but none of the stories have endings (just the items you gain) meaning it is PERFECT for improvisation. https://t.co/C0vQPXJFZ7

One of my favorite board game now... It's rather simple at first and then as we gain more pieces, we can solve more puzzles~

@twlldun @aspirationalbob @WTarbiat Turns out a character led show doesn‚Äôt work when you reduce everything to pieces on a game board to fit a schedule. But it does also mean the books are now stymied if they try the same ending as even if they could make it earned it will land as naff.

OLIVER: I still have my queen on the board. Emily Bespin. She is still my piece to play. My strategy resides in the long game, as it always has. I can see through the chaos of circumstance to the intricate order I have orchestrated.

@RavenSoftware Ending SBMM on Monday was a joke. It really added to the game. Get them on board to help with what players want. I won‚Äôt play as much now. Checking lobbies, weekly break down of trio, duo stats etc kept me on my phone whilst playing. Such a shame and greedy on your part.

@attrakta @lfc_ik @hassony77 @HarryLFC_ @TheAthleticUK @David_Ornstein he will probably start  alongside Vvd but but also needs to rest as well none of our CB'S will play every game, just trust the board we'll see what happens but before the summer we still have the champions league and top 4 to fight for so we should focus on that

I'm really warming to playing board game apps on my Nintendo Switch which is something I've not really done before. While the controls are less easy than using my phone or Steam, I enjoy how much more relaxing it is than using my laptop

Do you use your Switch for board game apps

If Ubisoft actually decides to make this game into a series where each new game focuses on different Gods and mythologies i'd be totally on board!!!!as long as they put the same amount of details and attention and love into to the story https://t.co/k2JDkjtZ0o

@PlayHearthstone Hi, Two mama bears, +4/+4 each on board with a Savannah Highmane. when it dies, I see the hyenas go up to 10/10 then BACK DOWN to 6/6. Beast is pretty rough because of this and cost me a game.

@BrendanJ466 @NECA_TOYS Cheers! I had a wee deek at them and some of the others that usually stock them, but nothing so far. I am impatient for Gargoyles ü§ì the board game in August was enough of a tease, but this..

@Qfunny I love those kinda moments. When I made my story board, I called those moments 'game changers' too lol
===
@mYiAspartem It has a very board-game feel to it, I think you'd like it a lot
===
There's a certain tactile satisfaction to placing each tile, like a board game piece. It's a slow and gentle exploration that gets the balance between push and calm just right.
===
@DaLJBeast I loved that game. Never cleared a 99 board but was a medium level champ.
===
@neilljthompson That was my favourite board game as a child. Glad to hear the mouse is still running the gauntlet. Happy Easter Neill.
===
@MaggiBot I only say that cos I follow you cos of board game stuff. Tsuro and Catan look nicely done. My Quest friends aren‚Äôt interested. We‚Äôve enjoyed meeting up in mini golf tho. Quest is amazing and the tip of the iceberg for what vr could be for gaming, remote socialising and media.
===
@MaggiBot Yeah, I only wanna do the VR social thing or MP with people I already know. Lots of people are cool, some aren‚Äôt. Mild social anxiety.

I can see the potential for some interesting board game conversions that don‚Äôt just simulate sitting at the table though.

@frogthebumV2 Okay I think I figured out the whole game board thing
===
@frogthebumV2 There‚Äôs also another part to the whole game board thing. There‚Äôs different sections of game Board entirely like bottom of it where ‚Äúthe rest of existence resides‚Äù
===
@frogthebumV2 So there‚Äôs actually three forms of Maria which would be umeniko maria (the one in the game board) human domain Maria (the one who manipulates the board) and creator maria the boundless one
===
@frogthebumV2 Okay so she herself is in the umeniko world but her higher form (I.E the one over the board) can freely manipulate what ever on the game board

@frogthebumV2 For example she was killed but survived by having her higher form out her back on the game board

I was so on board with the first game being better even after 70 hours in, but then that changed and it might just be my favorite of the two.

‚ÄúLife is a game you cannot win through having the most points or a high score, or the number one spot on the leader board: 'tis a game where you strive to become the best version of yourself. That is the essence of true winning; transcendence of black-&amp;-white nature.‚Äù T. Redtail.

@Col_Skidaddle @DuckDuckGusev Why is that okay to call in the same game that Krejci got tripped and nothing was? Do you see the issue? This game was called horribly from the start. Bruins didn't do themselves any favors but that 1st goal should have stayed on the board imo.
===
@jaytw10 @DuckDuckGusev And taking a goal off the board with 1:10 left in a 1-0 game did just that
===
The coldest take I constantly hear from board game people is: "Dice Rolling bad because you can get screwed over by bad rolls".

Yes. Thats part of the risk. You need to play... to mitigate... the risk. That's why the board game is called.... risk.

The gist is rather than escalating how threatening T is, we instead keep the rest of the game under control to keep it at the same level as T. 

Too many blockers? Damage-based board wipes. Engines going out of control? Disenchants and graveyard removal. https://t.co/Ls3XRhWHuJ

And the match meant so much to the country, the Faroese Tourist board bought the rights to the match and made this documentary on the game, available to watch here on their Youtube channel. https://t.co/f43DCECXPK

@dana_howl I HIGHLY suspect some clever folks will port it into Tabletop Simulator just like they have for countless other board games including Chaos in the Old World along with fantasy battles, AoS games, and 40k matches. Easy for those worlds apart!
