@bergerbell When a blue check asks a question like this, it is to maintain the narrative and to increase compliance. It has nothing to do with actual guidance. People listening to Fauci and the CDC are morons.

@GowTolson Eradication not irradiation. Damn late night texting with no glasses.

@GowTolson Idiot. Vaccines were introduced after irradiation. And cholera? Really? It’s a bacteria.

@interpolated Is this true? How does it work?

What's happening is that if you comply with any of this, you are part of the problem. Wake up America. The CDC cannot give you back your freedom. Because if they can, you're not really free, are you?

@districtai Silly rabbit. There is no pandemic.

@epopppp @AnnCoulter @mitchellatedf If places like Harvard cared about poor people or BIPOC - they would start more colleges to serve them. But they don't. Exclusively is their currency and they use their institutions as power centers to affect policy here and abroad. They are the problem.

@PurpleHamGamer Same, that's why I denied your marriage proposal. This isn't complicated.

@PurpleHamGamer Nah, he'll wake up soon. I'm still waiting
 Dude must have been exhausted

@PurpleHamGamer He's still sleeping. He should be fine after he wakes up. He seems really stiff now, so he may have been really tired
===
@PurpleHamGamer I think it's too late. I electrocuted my friend with 1300v, he hasn't moved in a few hours. I him out when he was on fire, but he still hasn't moved. I'll let you know when we wakes up. I put a blanket on him cuz he seems cold.

4 times higher is no coincidence.

Turning a blind eye to this is so inhuman.

There’s no such a thing as contagion or deadly pathogens invading the body. I’d love to see him debate Amandha Vollmer. No need for any jab ever.

If people are full of virus and symptomatic, to avoid them. This man is continually contradicting himself.

I meant it about being able to produce examples, &amp; I've quite seriously posted links to science papers about vaccine risks.
I genuinely don't understand why vaccine opponents on ttfh just regurgitate antivax talking points w/o engaging w/ science.

So instead
Could you give one or two examples of vaccine science that lacks rigor, reliability &amp;/or replicability?

@pinkpancreas @IndieWire Perhaps we should wait for JIM CROW 2.0 to take affect and then we will worry about our non security under GQP policies. Our time is now
===
@pinkpancreas @ElDubb @IndieWire It s about saving the SOUL of our country. The constitution needs to be considered a baseline tool not a set in stone. To keep it we need to defend voting. We suffer together, to make the point that corporations should not fund GQP insurrectionists. Corporations are not people
===
@pinkpancreas @IndieWire Hello, money, their corporate sponsors need to be made to understand that voter suppression is unacceptable and yes we all suffer to make this point. Shame them don t work for them if u don t have to
===
@pinkpancreas @IndieWire R u serious, the GQP and tRump were killing us anyway they could, with Covid, etc. We should worry about a little more pain I stead of protesting and boycotting, I m sorry it works.
===
@pinkpancreas @ElDubb @IndieWire So we accept the status quo, we are suffering now b/c of needing 2 or 3 jobs to survive.   "is that the solution? " Build back better"
===
@pinkpancreas @IndieWire That s where you are wrong, it does hurt big companies when you boycott,  the fact that I work in a low wage job and Don t get benefits I deserve is the same fight.

@Rubysfirefly mhm.. idk if that would work tho either bc like.. I think she meant more “I’ll always be a part of you in your heart” rather than “I’m actually a part of you now” cries

I CANT ANDJDJDN I cant believe she didn’t say that after cinder hurt her. we were ROBBED trixie 😔 /lh /j
===
@Rubysfirefly imagine how terrible she’d be at swearing so maria gets committed to teaching her how to do it right omg. pietro is unable to stop her.
===
@Rubysfirefly ugh I’m so sorry he did that. that’s disgusting. D: 

on the bright side THAT WAS AN ABSOLUTE WIN FROM YOU AKSJSNDN
===
@Rubysfirefly AMAZING LIST OOMF!! category just for penny so true 😌😌😌
===
@jerry_era @Rubysfirefly THEYRE BONDING EVERYTHING IS GREAT 😌
===
@Rubysfirefly OH MY GOD IM SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT
I can't imagine being so shallow that you'd have to send dick pics to people you don't even know, that sounds awful. He got what he deserved.

@Buzzarddogfish @Axel9850 @NRA @tedcruz @mikepompeo @Jim_Jordan @BurgessOwens @markrobinsonNC I’d rather take my chances trying to outrun a car than a barrage of bullets  from an automatic/assault rifle.
===
@toilingturtle @ElDubb @IndieWire I totally agree but @ what cost and to whom? These people that depend on the tv &amp; movie industry are suffering now bc they have to work to support themselves &amp; their families. Their healthcare benefits hinge on the industry. They need the jobs. Maybe ask them
===
@toilingturtle @IndieWire I don’t follow what you’re trying to say here?? It seems like you’re saying instead of boycotting but then what are you saying works instead? I’m saying boycotting hurts people who need jobs &amp; helps no one. It doesn’t seem to hurt politicians.
===
@toilingturtle @IndieWire Not everyone has the luxury of getting to choose the best job or the job they want- many have to take what they can get especially when they have families to take care of. This hurts &amp; punishes the wrong people who are innocent.
===
@toilingturtle @IndieWire I said I didn’t think it hurt politicians. I did not say it didn’t hurt companies. But if it does hurt companies that seems to be more in the long term. It more directly,severely &amp; quickly hurts the poor working class who need the jobs now.
===
@ElDubb @toilingturtle @IndieWire You don’t get it either. People depend on movies and tv so they can have jobs so they can eat and have a roof over their families’ heads. Be able to afford medicine &amp; healthcare etc.Boycotting puts people out of jobs. It’s not about watching movies.
===
@IndieWire This is the kind of thing that also happened in North Carolina- that’s honorable you’re taking a stand against injustice but you are just hurting the people who rely on the movie &amp; tv industry to make a living. The politicians still get paid the same amount.
===
@tedwilliamsgoat @IndieWire So they should wait four more years to vote out the corrupt politicians? They need jobs NOW! GET IT?!?!
===
@Rubysfirefly /safe
===
@Rubysfirefly immediately thought of that lmao

@Rubysfirefly not anymore

@NinaNinaNina95 @wintercataru @pixAlice_ @LottieStarshot @PurpleHamGamer *ears pirk up*
someone say among us?
===
@pinkpancreas @toilingturtle @IndieWire You don’t get it and you never will! Tell me how many people died while trying to get movies produced in their states? Ok. Now tell me how many people died trying to have the right to vote? You still want to have a debate about movies? Movies is movies. Voting is consequences!
===
@Rubysfirefly THAT LIL BOY FROM THE MOVIE WITH THE GUITAR???
