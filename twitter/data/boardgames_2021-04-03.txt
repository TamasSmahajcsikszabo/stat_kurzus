@mitchd_90 A good video or board game has good balance, and is defined by the risk reward actions of the player. 

The current rules do not apply the appropriate risk to the actions, a 6 again is not an appropriate deterant.

Basically the sport is currently broken as a game.

@davidscottjaffe This stance all of a sudden where people are refusing to buy games and immediately shit on people/platforms that do needs to fucking stop. Imagine expecting everyone to get on board with a model that allows access to any game they want for a meer $20/month.

@babytoolkit If you want to speed the game up, look for the Liar's Dice club rules on Board game Geek and use them with the fluff dice. It cuts game time considerably without sacrificing the fun.
===
@HdE_playsgames In a perfect world you should still feel like the game is complete with and without the expansions. That‚Äôs with board games. As for TTRPGs and the endless splat books that‚Äôs a hole that can almost never end.
===
@HdE_playsgames My take away is this. Base game must feel good to play and feel complete from the get go. If it doesn‚Äôt it can go to hell. Expansions MUST add new things to the game beyond a new board and extra gubbins.

@LJB2k_ @trevaughn_i @HenryTheBlasian Lets say you see julius randle on your board and have a 5 ball drop, you can drop 4 of your balls and try to get him. If you don‚Äôt get randle, you can close app while your on your 5th ball. The next time you finish a game, you can see the same prizes (julius randle).
===
Most of the planned expansions for the board game (as far as I can tell, they're not available to buy in the UK yet) take their names from key parts of the game. 'The Heart of the Nora,' for example. Even the Frozen Wilds DLC gets an expansion module named after it.
===
Coffee fueled early morning thread:

Lately, for a work thing, I've been doing a bit of research into TTRPGs and board games. I'm finding it fascinating. 

But I'm also growing to despise the 'buy the game, then buy six variably priced expansions for a fuller experience' model.
===
This piques my interest because it's more Horizon Zero Dawn (also, interestingly, there's a narrative aspect that places it after the events of the game.)

Feedback in the online board game community suggests that it's excellently designed, but quite repetitive.
===
I'm no expert in this stuff, and I have no idea how commonplace this is as a practice in selling modern board games. But it seems like a very cynical sales strategy to me. Almost as if these planned expansions are a tacit admission that the core game isn't... finished?
===
Moving on, though, I see Horizon Zero Dawn's got its own board game adaptation. And it looks kind of simple at a glance. Like a mash-up of a tabletop war game and a collectable card game. https://t.co/X4Z8n3N1c7

1:06 left in the first, Fluvanna gets on the board with a big man touchdown, as Ryan Morris gets his first career touchdown, 7-7 tie game

@GLiveSport @Glasgow_Live Quite right. Guy flys around world for his Nat king n gets less! But should put a rule down. Any1 caught gets 10 game ban make it fair across board.

Just reminded that in some conversation about impossible tie-ins @deadlyreg once suggested a Blood Meridian boardgame, and the idea has never quite left my head. No one wins this game, it is only a question of who dies last. Knives are permitted of course. War is God.

@Dr_Aust_PhD Absolutely. We need to be networking between areas to share new ideas for developing #chess. Open air events can revive the over-the-board game, bringing social benefits to club players and boosting participation by making chess more visible in the community.

@mack_sand @Fred08oficial Scott McTominay plays the same role and scores and assists so that arguments voided

Regardless of red cards the amount of stupid fouls he gives away every game is embarrassing. Fans like you are the reason the board get away with poor investments, happy with mediocrity
===
@pantsmcshirt @_rcmclaughlin @JoeBiden @MLB Not only that, but all the fans who would've attended the game can now return to work, so if anything this is only creating more jobs, and in sectors across the board...

it's bad for his/jed's game if vic leaves this week, and beth slipped up saying that ro was on board because he thinks she wants to turn on the boys.. she wants to keep ro because she wants him to go after ty. it makes complete sense he's pushing hard against it? #bbcan9 https://t.co/8ddjhFKHXh

@JikissGamer Yes haha! I tried an AMD X5/5x86 at 160MHz and my board can handle that, but it HATES write-back mode at that speed and constantly crashes. It's hilarious when it drops to 40 column. Ultima 4 is SO bad with that, but that's one of the reasons why that game is a treat haha!

No one asked but as a connoisseur of irl games (mainly tabletop, board, and party) and without even touching the cultural issues with it....

In the late 90‚Äôs Tomb Raider had a trading card game. The interesting part is that it played more like a board game (You would explore and fight others in a tomb &amp; it could be played solo).

I'm really a fan of TyTy Washington's game. The athleticism is impressive. He can make open shots, but it's more about the ability to get into the lane and make something happen ‚Äî a pass, finish or just forcing help.

Then you watch him grab a board and go end to end. Special.

Early on, you can see Gradey Dick is super engaged after a bit of a disappointing game Thurs.

@KikoEnjani I know the feeling - not even sure when my docs will decide it's safe for me to actually go to places with people in them. :( In the past, though, I've found a shared activity works - hence why I've had good luck with board game cafes. I hear good things about volunteering, too.

If @IamDimuth &amp; @thiri66 survived for next 10-15 overs and put another 50-60 runs on board, I really like to see @NiroshanDikka bat at no: 3 to show that @OfficialSLC are fighters. We might a chance to win this game if we take calculated risk. üá±üá∞üá±üá∞üá±üá∞

@BristolCity Enjoyed that. Pretty much said if you‚Äôre not committing to the club, you ain‚Äôt playing. And with nothing to play for now I‚Äôm fully on board with that. Give the kids some game time and see what we‚Äôve got to work with for next season.

Holy Cross transfer Matt Faw has committed to NJIT. Faw started every game for Holy Cross this season, averaging career highs across the board. Immediately becomes one of the best players on the Highlanders roster. #NJIT

@davidscottjaffe If Game Pass doesn‚Äôt prove profitable, or if its margins are no larger for Microsoft than its traditional console business, Sony may have the last laugh.

Game Pass is literally Phil Spencer‚Äôs last chance to save Microsoft‚Äôs gaming division else the Board kills it off.
===
@skooks @SaintsForecast @RossJacksonNOLA It really surprised me that they gave this concession to the owners. I've also never agreed with a 17th game (not that my opinion on this matters), and I'm not surprised players aren't on board.

Seigfried is a matchup I find very difficult, but I had hoped to at least get one game on the board. A few silly mistakes, misinputs, and drops shattered that for me. That‚Äôs not to say Jorge wasn‚Äôt the better player‚Äîhe adjusted to me way better than I to him and rightfully won.

The Infinite Conclusion I've already reached makes sense to Me in a new way! I shrink Evil to 0, and Good along with It. It's an irrational number.

It's like moving onto a chess board, then the whole board is claimed so win the game for Everyone, forever.

While illustrator David is busy working on the game board, I made a few new suggestions for cards to be included in MAZE MATCH. Since I'm trying to keep language out of the game, it's tricky to find a way to communicate rules through icons.

@McCaw_art @Nintendokusou The reason wasn‚Äôt parental outrage, it was a series of changes in how games are evaluated by PEGI, Europe‚Äôs game safety rating board which would leave the game with a much higher rating for simulated gambling.

#ncfc DF: 'We had so many situations to finish the game off. So many chances. But 4 minutes went up on the board. Tim Krul clears the ball. No whistle. Then we don't put enough pressure on the ball. But it took two deflections and goes through Andrew's legs. Cruel.'

@ReillyEagles Yeah, pretty much any board game that is heavy, or looks like a nerd game is worth giving a scan. Some you will be gated on Amazon so you got to check eBay too.

@lukewoodso @jonrogerswriter What the hell is your issue? Yeah it‚Äôs disappointing to drop points but in the grand scheme it‚Äôs a game gone and another point on the board.
