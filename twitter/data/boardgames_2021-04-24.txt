@Markgubicza 
I'm not sure if there has been a rule change, but that botched call by the home plate umpire in the 1st took a run off the board for the Angels may very well play a huge factor if this game goes extra innings. Can managers still protest a game based on a bad call?

@Gamefreakgeek It's a very "be present" experience. I grew up extremely lonely and loneliness has become my shield. When I'm playing a board game with someone I care about I feel less lonely. It's why it's hard to play with strangers for me because I feel vulnerable being happy.
===
@Gamefreakgeek This is also why I don't solo game. It literally provides none of what gives me joy about board games and amplifies my loneliness.

Benn Mathurin is returning to Arizona. Big one off the board for the 2021 NBA Draft. Was all over the map for NBA evaluators.

I think the two most intense imagination reactions I‚Äôve had to board games came from Arkham Horror the Card Game and Kingdom Death Monster.

@ByYourLogic Scolded me cuz I would trip kids and laugh in preschool. Banned me from drinks with red dye in Pre-K. Forced me to write my name on the board for in 1st grade. Cried every gym class I lost a game until age 10. Guess what? Now I‚Äôm a Patron of the most exclusive podcasts on Earth

@Oblivion91218 @AnimeLegendFN That‚Äôs not a gun that‚Äôs just some random present I think it‚Äôs a football or a board game

a bad person.

i wouldnt mind seeing him forced to wear a sandwich board with the words "Lying if His Mouth Moves" if he goes out on future dates. What was his end game?

===
@dpbrugler @sureman87 i always wonder - what causes a player like Jones to move up the board months after playing his last game? Is it all just his pro day (or combine in other years)?
===
@ConcernedApe Any update on 2nd prints of the board game? Thanks for all your work as always!!
===
I know nothing about the game and it might be a 10/10 burn-the-rest-of-your-collection game but my God, just looking at the board is enough to make my head swim.

It's not just a board game! It's so much more! Don't be scared to try. For a chilling and horrifying experience, try out Chilling Screams. You never know what's luring inside. üò± üò±

As for what kinds of games, I do like puzzle games, strategy games, board game-based games, casual games, RPGs, etc. Not too keen on FPSes or "collection" games.

Lots of good suggestions coming in here, I'm going to get to playing!

@Magical__Hacker Part of being a threat is defending your position on the board and in the game, and knowing who you're threatening.

Just saw an ad for a new game on BGG banner that just told you how many literal Lb and Kg of content you get...

board games marketing is in a weird place...

Then flip the board, pull out your preferred weapon, &amp; demand a better game to play.

Finished Heavensward in #FFXIV and I am fully on board with this game now, very excited to take this dancer through the rest of the expansions. https://t.co/5iN224Ehd7

So we all discussed what we should do with the extra bedroom, and we all collectively agreed that we would make it an office space/board game room. It was great for about 3 months, and then we were called to a meeting with our problem roommates.

Almost spent 100+ on a board game because one of the characters is non-binary üßçüßç(it‚Äôs also beautiful as all hell but besides the point) managed to control my urges tho :) taking a shower and then filming dom content, if anyone comments a specific theme or pet names I‚Äôll do it!!

@FlyPigGames @BitrichInfo hey there. working on PokerBrawls. A casual, pvp, strategy action twisted poker game where you can affect the board and opponent hand with special cards https://t.co/ZJ79tNTcDD

Currently getting into a great board game I just got, Planet of the Apes, based on the 1968 movie. It's obvious the designer is an "Apes" fan. You play Taylor, trying to survive. Hard to win but fun, like being inside the movie. Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty apes! https://t.co/4qu4FKuuSO

Help me win this awesome competition to have my cat featured in the new board game, CATastrophe! https://t.co/ZiN9hg70on

More clarifications. Any analog game played on a table top in real life or Tabletopia, Board Game Arena, or Tabletop Simulator will work. And one entry per Extra Life page. So if two EL peeps play 1 game, that's 1 entry per person. 
Play games, help kids.

@zachurrate In a year (or two), I will come back to my board-game page, and one big vision is `No number ratings`‚Ä¶ not sure how to solve the lack of a possible option to filter and sort‚Ä¶ but I would like to try something else - new - more palpable

For @LettersThem3 her Digimon would be BlackGatomon who digivolves into LadyDevimon. 

Anyone who has ever played a board game or any game with her knows just how evil and chaotic Cass is. So LadyDevimon seems perfect. https://t.co/1scauFdcYM

@murbanvideo I always like the names Coco Crisp, Homer Bailey, Grady Sizemore, Chipper Jones and of course the board game man himself Milton Bradley
===
Am I about to spend $300 on a board game.... Maybe...
===
@Bailouwu @MisterContrast I want you to look at the leader board real quick. This is supposed to be a fun and simple game mode where people can unwind from casual Brawlhalla. The fact that the pros are taking this more seriously than I am (Cosolix sitting with over 100 wins) makes this a sweat fest now
