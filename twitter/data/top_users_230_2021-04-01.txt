Health first.

@Spike11232 The URL at the bottom of your graphic says your graphic is a lie.

According to it, there were 3,365,319 deaths in 2020, an increase of 510,481, up 17.9%.

That's the LARGEST year-to-year increase in 102 years.
===
@Jonnyporkchop @BGBandita Obviously.

Total deaths,
2019: 2,854,838
2020: 3,365,319
+510,481

Total COVID deaths in 2020: 330,406

It's likely that COVID deaths were under-reported in 2020.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom Not really, but stable. Not a made up rumor, like the ones that you obediently repeat as commanded by your conspiracy-cult's dogma.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom I've haven't spent much time thinking about it, but I question if it's an implementable idea.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom You think that all 3,002 county medical examiners, all 50 states, the CDC &amp; the Social Security Administration are engaged in a massive criminal conspiracy to report 500,000 deaths that never happened?

Because that's the only way to fake total deaths.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic Did you actually read this?

This is happening in Afghanistan, Yemen and sub-Saharan Africa. It's not happening in the US. It's a crisis, sure, but it's not impacting the US numbers.
===
@denandvic1 @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX How does this prove that the US death rate was the same in 2019 than 2020?
===
@GrowtheFKUP @MillennialOther And the stupid meme. I get who you are. If ignorance is bliss, you must be very happy.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom That explains nothing.

Changing the cause-of-death on paper has ZERO impact on the number of total deaths from all causes. It simply exchanges one cause for another.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom I noticed you switched topics away from your false claims about the number of deaths.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom The only reason you believe that is that Trump told you that, “This is their new hoax,” that was being used to hurt him.

The idol that you worship commands, you obedient repeat the lies.

You surrendered up your agency to mental slavery under a dogma.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic I'm not arguing for lockdowns. I'm arguing against fake data.

And you just proved you're an irrational conspiracy theorist. You really think that the medical examiners in the reddest counties in the reddest states are involved in a plot to fabricate 500K deaths with no bodies?

Good.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic Again with the made up data. 170M. Laughable. I'm going to ignore you. You're not worth the time.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom So where did you get your info that deaths were the same in 2019 &amp; 2020? You so confidently made the statement. Where did it come from?
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic Ummm... "The model has not been published or peer-reviewed yet"

There was a similar model put out last year by researchers at Penn. It was withdrawn after review.
===
@GrowtheFKUP @MillennialOther Ok. That's age adjusted death rate vs aggregate rate. 

Fine, using age adjusted numbers of 7.2 and 8.2 you'll see a rate increase of 13.9%

That's still the largest year-to-year percent rate increase in over a century.
===
@GrowtheFKUP @MillennialOther By the way. Those are CDC numbers. So no they don't report different numbers. The CDC reports that 510,418 more Americans died in 2020 than 2019 for a net increase of 17.9%, the largest year-to-year percent increase in over a century.

That's a fact.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic Deaths from all causes can't be double counted. If the sum of causes equals deaths from all causes there is no double counting.

They match. There is no double counting. You need a new rumor to spread.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic So, there really isn't CDC data. It's all county level rolled up. To create 500K deaths that never occurred, to inflate the number of total deaths, would require a coordinated conspiracy involving thousands of state and local officials with no relationship to the CDC.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic So, you think that 3,002 county medical examiners, all 50 states, the CDC, the NIH and the Social Security Administration have all enjoined in a mass conspiracy to report 500K deaths that never happened?

Because that's the only way to fake the number of total deaths.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic If you really think that's what happened in 2020, I bet you're really excited about the actual, physically real, Easter Bunny coming to visit this weekend, because you believe in fairytales.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic If those deaths attributed as COVID were going to happen anyway or were falsely attributed, other causes of death would have been down in 2020. They weren't. They were up. Way up. 4.8%.

https://t.co/qv6bvo1t4H
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom If you really think that's what happened in 2020, I bet you're really excited about the actual, physically real, Easter Bunny coming to visit this weekend.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 False. This total matches the total for deaths from all causes.

Again, you have no idea what you are talking about.

Obviously, data and math aren't your thing.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic That .003 number is made up.

And, if you knew what you were taking about you'd know that the infection fatality rate is only half the picture when determining how deadly a disease is.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom I don't care about vaccine passports. I care about accurate data. Which, obviously, is something you despise, if it doesn't fit the agenda that you've swallowed.
===
@denandvic1 @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX By the way. That exact same souce says that 565,256 Americans have died from COVID-19. https://t.co/zADGx5STDf
===
@GrowtheFKUP @MillennialOther Here's the real data. 

2020,
Deaths: 3,365,319
Pop: 331.0M
Rate: 10.2 per-thousand

2019,
Deaths: 2,854,838
Pop: 328.2M
Rate: 8.7 per-thousand

Rate increase: 17.2%

Largest year-to-year rate increase in 102 years.

2019: https://t.co/PLfbUcuzEV
2020: https://t.co/hu3sTrZXf3
===
@GrowtheFKUP @caeser_pounce @naeriface @MillennialOther Well, I can see the complete failure of the American education system is on full display tonight.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic Total non-COVID deaths were up 4.8% over total deaths in 2019. That would have been the largest year-to-year percent increase since 1928, without COVID.

So your little story about how the deaths were falsely attributed is nonesense. There was no measurable switching causes.
===
@GrowtheFKUP @MillennialOther "NOTE: All 2020 and later data are UN projections and DO NOT include any impacts of the COVID-19 virus," at the top of the page.

That's a UN projection made in Aug 2019. It used NO actual 2020 data. It's completely WRONG. https://t.co/FCRSQIbi5b
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic So then you know there's no way to report 500,000 incremental deaths and make the breakdown of those numbers match across 3,500 independently operated systems without a coordinated criminal conspiracy.
===
@Tampke @darkenrahl86 @FrancaRose33 @airmaxknight @RealDoctorT @yammerapple @Destrier15 @SoldierOneEaODG @SHOSTUNZ @AggressiveDem @seannlauren @DarkLor23935043 @Steven_Swenson @DebLeeFab1 @ReignOfHeathens @MarkWEccleston @CleeseRaymond @Libertybibbledy @kglarson @badjin_rank @photoartist9 @extremecompute @jamminhaus @MaddHawk77 @JonesMurphy @BenjaminHampson @dslinfreak @cleflore23 @762x25Tokarev @Kasiagabrielle1 @JacquotLeGrand @46_billy @Peaches_Sabrina @FlynDutchman466 @insaneknight85 @Peyton_PTP_ @Gormogons @samg399 @FBIWFO @LincolnProject3 @CocaCola What was corrected?
===
@vagrantcatholic @AnnulmentProof @SamRochadotcom And, all 50 states, and all 3,002 counties.

The CDC data matches the sum of each state's reporting. Each state matches the sum of the county reporting.

If it's a lie then it's a conspiracy all the way down to the reddests county in the reddest states.
===
@denandvic1 @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX False. COVID is unrealted to the flu.

SARS-CoV-2 is in the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales.

Influenza is in the Orthomyxoviridae in the order Articulavirales.

They are completely unrelated.

Obviously you don't know what you are talking about.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom You read wrong.
===
@Whatsuppeepswo1 The URL at the bottom of your graphic says your graphic is a lie.

According to it, there were 3,365,319 deaths in 2020, an increase of 510,481, up 17.9%.

That's the LARGEST year-to-year increase in 102 years.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic Doesn't look like it. https://t.co/50bMP7Lm8o
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic What really happenes, is that in  all 50 states, death data is aggregated from the county level. Each state has their own process for aggregation. The states then submit weekly updates to the CDC, who then compile the totals.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom You still haven't explained how 510,000 more Americans died in 2020 than 2019.

Or, are you going with the every county, state and multiple branches of the federal government are engaged in a massive conspiracy?
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic Let's face it. You don't know. You already claimed that deaths were being double counted in multiple causes, which I quickly proved false. You just ignored it and moved on.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom There's really no such thing as CDC data. In all 50 states, death data is aggregated from the county level. Each state has their own process for aggregation. The states then submit weekly updates to the CDC, who then compile the totals.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom You pulled your claims from thin air.
===
@denandvic1 @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX 1st. That's global data. It says nothing about the US 

2nd. It's a vague estimate. Nobody really knows the current global population. Many countries have no idea how many people were born or died.

3rd. We have very accurate data in the US, which I already posted.
===
@denandvic1 @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX Nothing that you've posted is vaugely accurate. You're obviously a cultist who will obediently believe and repeat any lie that substantiates the denialist dogma pressed by the hard-right political fringe.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic You're the perfect example of not taking it seriously. You are denying the existence of 500,000 deaths in the US. So add another decimal point, what difference does that make? You would still make all the same, false, denialist arguments.
===
@GrowtheFKUP @MillennialOther 0.17 percentage points is 19.5% of 0.87%.

So, yes, it REALLY is.
===
@GrowtheFKUP @MillennialOther Since your math argument failed, you switched to philosophy...

The largest increase in total deaths in over a century... A once in a hundred year event... But, it's just another part of life... or at least that's what you say in blind obedience to your denialist cult's dogma.
===
@vagrantcatholic @AnnulmentProof @SamRochadotcom "But I read somewhere..."

Yeah, in some BS tweet.

Here's a post, with souce data links, that I posted on Dec 30th, with counts through week 47 (Dec 5) that shows 3,041,698 as of Dec 5.

https://t.co/wjS0qom9OW
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic Do you actually have a cogent point? Or, is saying, "I don't like it, so it must be wrong," in a snarky way, and posting stupid memes all you've got?
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom It's a virus. It doesn't have a political system.
===
@GrowtheFKUP @MillennialOther Not a big deal?

2020,
Deaths: 3,365,319

===
@Jonnyporkchop @BGBandita We will. But, provisional doesn't mean, "estimated." It means that multiple states are still compiling data, so it really means, "incomplete." The final 2020 number will be slightly higher than the current provisional counts.
===
@denandvic1 @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX False. Overall deaths were not similar. I've shown you that's incorrect. So far you've shown me a global population estimate, from the same souce that says 565,000 Americans died of COVID-19.

Obviously you think the souce you posted are liars.
===
@denandvic1 @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX I can't even begin to unpack all of these flow of consciousness babbling. In minutes I already pointed out multiple factual errors.

Your souce, that you claim shows no increase in deaths, also shows 565,000 COVID deaths. So, is it a valid source or not?
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom Nope. Not even close.

Total deaths,
2019: 2,854,838
2020: 3,365,319
+510,481
+17.9%

Largest year-to-year increase in 102 years.

===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom So, there really isn't CDC data. It's all county level rolled up. To create 500K deaths that never occurred, to inflate the number of total deaths, would require a coordinated conspiracy involving thousands of state and local officials with no relationship to the CDC.
===
@denandvic1 @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX Total deaths in the US were up by 17.9% in 2020. That's not just the CDC. The CDC numbers match the numbers put out by all the states. The state numbers match all 3,002 counties.

Are they all conspiring together to report an extra 500,000 deaths that never happened?
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom Yes, but it's a fact. There were 510,000 more deaths in the US in 2020 than 2019. That hasn't been refuted, and it won't be. That's been confirmed, independently of the federal government, by all 50 states and DC.
===
@g_spray @drjstover Yeah, I really haven't dug into those big fluctuations early in the century. But, I believe the TB outbreaks were across multiple years.
===
@2020Boogaloo0 @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic You really haven't thought at all how data is generated, how it's compiled. I have no doubt that single government agencies are capable of all kinds of crimes. I don't see how at least 3,500 unrelated agencies at all levels of government could be coordinating to do that.
===
@PRider1980 @Space_Force1 @slh78_w04 @Jules31415 @brookeis32 @scs_real @UtProsim540 Here's the real data.

2020: https://t.co/hu3sTrZXf3
===
@GrowtheFKUP @MillennialOther In 2019 total deaths from ALL causes was only 0.87% of the population. An incremental 0.17 percentage points is huge.
===
@denandvic1 @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX The CDC never "admitted" that not all reported COVID deaths were COVID. That false nonsense gets repeated over and over on Twitter.

It, literally, never happened. It's totally false. There was no such public admission.
===
@AnnulmentProof @vagrantcatholic @SamRochadotcom Which brings us back to...

You think that all 3,002 county medical examiners, all 50 states, the CDC &amp; the Social Security Administration are engaged in a massive criminal conspiracy to report 500,000 deaths that never happened?

That's the only way to fake total deaths.

@numbers_truth @MillennialOther An increase is to be expected and the total number deaths attributed to the Rona over the past year has .17  percent of the US population so I say again not a big deal

@numbers_truth @MillennialOther The CDC report has different numbers from what you are quoting. Your 2019 link has 7.2 per 1000 and the 2020 report says 8.2
===
@naeriface @numbers_truth @MillennialOther See Daniel doesn't get that in the real world anything less than losing say 10 percent of the population world wide when said population is around 8 billion would have no real impact and is therefore not a big deal.
===
@numbers_truth @MillennialOther No it really isn't. People die it is part of life.
===
@numbers_truth @MillennialOther The point is that according the the CDC report in that article there were 8.28 deaths per thousand which was smaller than what the UN had predicted. Meaning the rona wasn't that big of a deal

===
@4TESLANZ @TroyTeslike @RandyVegetables @Tesla Careful: 15% of Q4 European deliveries is only ~5k units, and the effective quarter in China was a lot shorter due to the Chinese New Year.

So 200k for Q1 is definitely not in the cards I think - but if these numbers verify Tesla should beat 162k Wall Street expectations.
===
@eurotechjunkie No, this is certainly not Elon - if true then this is probably an email from the EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa) team leader.

These are only the European delivery numbers - there's also North America, China and APAC delivery numbers that make Q1 complete.
===
@TroyTeslike @RandyVegetables The leaked numbers seem to be internally consistent:

✅ in Q1'2020 Tesla delivered ~23k vehicles in Europe
✅ in Q4'2020 Tesla delivered ~36k in Europe
✅ +15% over Q4 is ~42k
✅ that is 1.82x the Q1'2020 deliveries - close to the 2x claim

Language also seems "Tesla authentic".
===
Why the leak of record Tesla Q1 European deliveries is authentic IMO:

✅ figures internally consistent
✅ record EU Q1 ships
✅ awkward April 1 timing
✅ fake leak would avoid typos in business email
✅ fake leak would leak global numbers
✅ reliable source of @RandyVegetables https://t.co/aqrPG6jXpw

@numbers_truth @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic I don't concern myself, nor are there any differentiators within the " left/right- blue/red) false paradigm. People poked fun at those who questioned grisly reality of the tuskegee project, cia mind control programs et al. Anything is possible.
===
@numbers_truth @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic Precisely because of what you said. No unified standard. That's how. I work on data daily, building software for financial systems, im keenly aware regarding inputs/outputs for data, generation, unstructured, structured, etc.
===
@numbers_truth @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic It's called double counting. All about control. Elitists can howl at the mon behind their pearly gates. Every day people are being far more adversely affected by lockdowns than anything. Bottom line you get sick, nobody but your own fault, regardless of name of illness.

@numbers_truth @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic Yes, the point is, " Sars Cov-2"  has a death rate of .003 seasonal flu is .001. It's about self care. 99% of those kicking the can are on deaths doorstep, and the way they count ( counting anyone who tests positive, but dies in any fashion inlcuding george floyd) is idiotic
===
@numbers_truth @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic As previously said, if you get ill, regardless or what illness, it's nobody but your own fault. The adverse effect on jobs, food, education, sanity, physical health, mental health, far outweighs the virus itself.

@numbers_truth @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic 2+ decimals. The fact of the matter is, with those " dying" the age brackets, co-morbidities, etc and all the other factors, lack of information/oversight, is the causal effect of not taking it seriously.

@numbers_truth @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic To achieve their end game? Undoubtedly. Absolutely. Answer me this: the death rate is negligible. People don't just die, but have numerous, " co-morbidities" to fall seriously ill or die. Why lock everyone down? What about personal responsibility. Don't go out if you're afraid.
===
@numbers_truth @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic I was speaking from a global perspective on the matter. No matter where it's happening, it's wrong. Data in a wide spread manner is being disseminated illogically for expected results of those in power, to justify fear mongering and lockdowns.
===
@numbers_truth @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic I absolutely know what i'm talking about. That # is not made up. Based on empirical  data, 170m+ americans have had " covid" do the math. What is more deadly are lockdowns, especially to lower class toddlers. Give me a break
===
@numbers_truth @BrandeeIAM @Makelifegreata2 @Picknflic My biggest worry is, by law of time and averages, and with 7.83B people on earth, a real, truly deadly, horrible pandemic to the levels of A black plague or '18 pandemic will occur, and because of this one, people will not take it seriously. 100's of millions + will perish

Hmm.

That doesn’t demonstrate a dispassionate ability to evaluate &amp; make rational judgements. Nor does your inarticulate &amp; ungrammatical tweets demonstrate much in the way of intellectual ability.

A vacuum with that cell in it, or it’s A BIG LIE!*

A Virus is not a cell. They can’t reproduce outside of one. Here’s an excellent explanation: https://t.co/6P4z6cMUMq

I presume you meant “tell more lies”, &amp; “much else” I think should be “much more besides” or some such.

Really 🤪

Interestingly, like the flu &amp; other viruses, the incidents of nits have declined markedly after school closures &amp; lockdowns last year. Kids are natural disease vectors in close proximity. Now we’re back, gastro &amp; cold-like infections are back on the rise.

@numbers_truth @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX 1. Read it again. Also use something besides goggle. We are a family of Medical/Legal/ some Feds Government etc. We are talking Covid deaths correct? The CDC admitted in public that not all deaths that were stated Covid were. We have see it personally &amp; had the death cert
===
@numbers_truth @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX lol  Not so but ,whatever floats your boat. Sorry I was neither a Dem or a Rep until about a couple months ago. our family myself included worked with Dems they are pure evil you seem to have no clue and are pretty rude feel sorry for you. When you have a lic. I do get back to me
===
@numbers_truth @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX 7. flu viruses. No data is accurate. even the CDC site states it if u look enough. As u research I suggest checking  Worldwide Doctors Alliance, They have no agenda. That is the difference or believe the purposely wide spread agenda Covid itself did not kill the amount u state.
===
@numbers_truth @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX 4.  It is not killing everyone that they claim. More people die from other diseases daily. There is an agenda it's not Trump but it's not good. This was expected it's not a surprise. I worked 4 the state as a nurse, Uncle 4 Feds. We discovered the CDC is part of a corrupt part .
===
@numbers_truth @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX 3. flu viruses. Overall deaths had a similar variable as previous years. There were increases here in the with non Covid diseases. As it is shown the Covid death numbers decrease as some were never legit. There is a virus &amp; it is more dangerous Resp wise. Never denied that.
===
@numbers_truth @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX As it shows the death is about the same in previous years. The death and birth rate is never exactly the same. We can go around in circles. You can believe how you feel is right. At this point we can just agree to disagree. Have a nice nite
===
@numbers_truth @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX 5. of the Gov. They meet the agenda needed at the time not what is reality. I was going to give u more. Some of my family has been following this &amp; stated when u started calling names 2 just ignore u not worth the time. It wouldn't matter what u were shown. People die of Covid as
===
@numbers_truth @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX 6. they do of many things. More recover over 99%. There were deaths with Covid but not from Covid  being placed on a respirator, &amp; or being denied meds that can save u easily causes death. Our Hospital chief stated there were never more pts than what they see during the seasonal
===
@numbers_truth @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX 8.I've learned of a MD treated pts   w/hydroxychloroquine, Zinc, Vit D,Motrin or Tylenol. No hosp. no deaths. Feel better being mouthy in ur bubble that's ok Research what our public servants signed in 2012 revisited in 2015,  effective by 2030. Say  u want. I'm done. rude=block
===
@numbers_truth @denaturedpima @RealCalvinX 2. corrected this is an issue. Many r done &amp; there reasons 4 that. None of them right. Unfortunately not the only disease it's done with. Excess deaths r what is not Covid. Covid is considered 3rd highest cause of death. Covid includes several viruses, same family as seasonal

@fatehshernu Change the metric of income to stress levels and working hours (that are required for those numbers) and you might find some truth in it. However, for a self occupied, no boss, ’free’ individual there is no top.

Lets take the universe out the equation. What are we? What controls the universe? Are we nothing? What is beyond the universe? What is the darkness it keeps expanding too? Is there a limit? Are we part of a larger structure that the universe seems bleak in comparison?

Open your eyes wide open
It's not always about numbers.

KayLee’s grandpa had another stroke. Looking bleak as we speak. If I disappear for awhile just know that’s where I am and dealing with that. Kind of a waiting game right now.

Tremendous accomplishments. 

Things change.
When they got bounced in 3 from Euro 00, fortunes looked bleak for hosting in '06.

They did a hard look at the team. That change sparked a run that eventually won the WC in Brazil.

Something similar is needed now.
