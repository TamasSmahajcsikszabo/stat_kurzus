Are you stuck at home not able to gather with friends to play your favourite game?

I feel like I'm playing Farmville the card game 

#MachiKoroBrightLightsBigCity https://t.co/eAnxmpWfsD

Okay we were reading the die roll number at the top of the card as the cost. 

We've now noticed we had a 0 cost and a 1 cost card out we could buy. https://t.co/JyJtKbMucI

I love that the cards in The Crew form a panorama.

Maybe we are missing something but so far we have gone four rounds with us just passing a die back and forth and rolling five or six and getting nothing for it.

@MagnettiAlan @spruesandbrews @tanith1st Not that one, they already reprinted that!

I want Advanced Heroquest, it was a much better game, more of an RPG like feel with actual character progression and shopping for gear, etc.

@ALEXMINAJUCHIS WHATS THIS GIFS NAME

@tacosdepanocha In the clip she expresses a preconceived notion that bisexual men are just gay men in disguise and is offended that he may be perceiving her as a man. This comes from a presumption that bisexuality itself doesn‚Äôt really exist, therefore it is biphobic.... but thats just my take

Day 25 of V-tubers Poems: @ShiroZenkoVT 

He appears before those
Drowning in hatred and violence
With his beauty and grace
Mending wounds, war cry turning into silence
Winning hearts and minds, like a hero
Inari fox spirit, known as Shiro

Foamy sticky tan head. Nice super dark pour. Sweeter than I remember. That's offset by a deeper earthiness. Some bitter dark chocolate tang as well. Very well balanced. - Drinking a Shoots &amp; Ski Stout by @glheritagebrew @ Untappd at Home  ‚Äî https://t.co/ofKBprMM9h

Sticky foamy head that just doesn't go away. It's like cotton candy on top of my very pink beer. Giving this a second shot. Still not a big cherry flavour fan in beer or not. It's not terrible but I would say I'm a fan.... (Cherry Pickin') https://t.co/VZKf3Zgz0w
===
At $12 a bottle this better be good ;) Smells fantastic. Tan head that's lasting but not clinging. Dark rich and a bit boozy. Espresso and dark chocolate. The saltiness is on the lips in the finish. Okay, yeah this is good. ... (Death Proof) https://t.co/QHkg2wrpwx

@T0nbridgewells @Clairina @ClareCraigPath Here's a link - https://t.co/umPR6Rlg34 - lots of good reviews too - 4.6/5. Looks good - thanks for drawing my attention to it.
===
@T0nbridgewells @Clairina @ClareCraigPath I also read some of your timeline.... CCP had lots of nonsense tweets like these - but she was embarrassed so deleted them https://t.co/GFZzFFZ4gK
===
Now regretting I didn't keep trying to learn when I hit second year at school... https://t.co/AJipWGbvu1
===
@AdamBanksUK @elucido @ClareCraigPath Charmed to meet you.

Good news. You can go back and delete all your bad tweets too https://t.co/80aaJGltY1 https://t.co/o6EUFnyBOx
===
If you're finding your saddle uncomfortable, then carry something to sit on when you get to your destination https://t.co/ikLglhrhvx
===
@elucido @ClareCraigPath And she can always delete the wrong bits... Just like she did last year when she deleted **everything**
===
@T0nbridgewells @Clairina @ClareCraigPath Oh look.. All proceeds go to charity https://t.co/DW2VnaQKwa
===
@ClareCraigPath I put this link on your response to the bmj - https://t.co/faBTzUGpWj - seems like that response should be changed?
===
@T0nbridgewells @Clairina @ClareCraigPath And blocked... :)
===
@Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis I'm a bit cautious of that particular report - some of the replies point out some leaps in translation, and that particular account has some links to a "pyramid" scheme called Amway. (But he's still a useful source sometimes!)
===
@Kit_Yates_Maths This Times article on December said the same thing https://t.co/HdxSunuqTP :/
===
@T0nbridgewells @Clairina @ClareCraigPath Yes. I'm a real person. And not embarrassed of what I've posted nor of my "big boy" size.

I suspect you're not embarrassed of what you post either... Which is a shame because it looks like you're often very wrong https://t.co/2WOTe3jaZC

Bye!

I have cycled through Ockham thousands of times... Either I've missed this sign of it's new.. Which is the simpler explanation? #ochamsrazor https://t.co/iR8F7SZVgz
===
@Crash_Hamster @Unusual_Times Anyways... Much as I fancy solving Covid before tea... and then moving on to the climate crisis... Right now I'm heading off outside for a walk... So have a "good" Friday... Laters!
===
@ClareCraigPath Just to confirm - you intend to research in detail every single one of the ~150000 deaths which have Covid on the death certificate, but at no point will you ask for or receive any money or other benefit?
===
@Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis Yeah... My translation skills aren't up to checking the facts on that one, let alone the nuances. There's a vaguely trollish account disputing ds's post - see https://t.co/QysqbpZ4a1 - not saying anything right now other than "I'm a bit cautious" :)
===
@ClareCraigPath This is looking at the 80+ age groups... Which means we're looking at the age groups where most people are fully vaccinated. Good to see you supporting the vaccinations. Please feel free to clarify what you think of the Hart antivax paper by Joel.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis As I said "I'm a bit cautious" ... Just being a good guy and always
checking sources... It is weird how with sweden the contrarian anti-government crowd are the pro-lockdown campaigners... :)
===
@Crash_Hamster @Unusual_Times I'm not really interested in "fault". As ever with Covid, there aren't any easy answers here :/
===
@JamesMelville It would appear you've never been good at reading the data, and that you're not getting any better... https://t.co/DSLEFotngf
===
@ClareCraigPath This response seems to be built on the Danish Moustsen-Helms report - which has been explained by the report author - see https://t.co/faBTzUGpWj - in light of this evidence, maybe you should consider retracting this response? https://t.co/AXEEN5RtqU
===
@EPluribusAnders @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis So you are ok with the claim that one hospital said its ICU was full, but you're saying that the reason it later reviewed that decision wasn't because there were no other places for people to go to?

After a year of this stuff I'm trying to steer clear of the personal attacks :)
===
@EPluribusAnders @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis Well I'm heading to bed.... So good night :)

@Crash_Hamster @slodge No need to say sorry. You are allowed your own opinion matey its no big deal.
===
@Crash_Hamster @slodge depends who you are interacting with mate üòÇüòÇ
===
@slodge @Unusual_Times I defy anyone to say that they *DO* care about each one of them.

Once you establish that no-one cares about every death, who and how many you help is an individual decision with no absolute right or wrong.
===
@Unusual_Times @slodge I know, I was apologising to myself more than anything. 

I'm proud of the UK's vaccine response; the EU's response has been awful.

I find it amazing that this somehow makes the UK small-minded etc. as per comments on your post.

See, interaction is bad. üòâ
===
@Unusual_Times @slodge We left the EU.

We've done an excellent job on our vaccination programme. 

The EU have done an awful job of theirs. They would rather their people died than use the AZ vaccine.

Somehow this is the UK's fault?
===
@slodge @Unusual_Times Indeed we do üòÄ

I'm a believer in the 'put your own oxygen mask on before helping others' school of compassion. Also 155,000 people per day die worldwide and there literally aren't enough hours in the day to care about all of them.
===
@slodge @Unusual_Times If the mighty EU with 2 of the world's top 6 economies can't organise a vaccination programme for its citizens, that's either gross incompetence or sacrificing its citizens' lives for political ends.

Not the UK's circus, not the UK's monkeys.
===
@slodge @Unusual_Times Neither am I, which is why I was surprised at the assertion that the UK should be doing more to help.

I understand that some people will spin things to point the blame for anything at the UK (see other replies to original tweet) and I swore I'd never engage.

I engaged.

Sorry!
===
@slodge @Unusual_Times I note that the Oxford Astra Zeneca vaccine is being manufactured and distributed at cost and the UK government has pledged to give surplus vaccines to covax.

I think that's pretty good and everyone involves deserves much credit. I'm amazed that others don't.

&lt;sorry üòâ&gt;
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar @HSELive Why is death all you are obsessed about? Having Long Covid and potential permanent health implications for the rest of your adult life is an equally valid concern for the young.
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Also, long covid should never be seen as a residual risk. That is so criminally negligent.
===
@skywalkerchief @Joannemurfi @McDonaghDJ @LeoVaradkar It means your more likely than someone who is working from home who has very low exposure to the virus. Exposure counts. If not, why were young healthcare workers vaccinated?
===
@McDonaghDJ @skywalkerchief @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar And then when it comes to kids, lipservice is paid to the importance of schools without any action to back it up. Proper mitigation measures (air filters, Co2 monitors) and staff vaccines are essential to the safe and permanent reopening of schools.
===
@McDonaghDJ @skywalkerchief @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar This also shows how young people are being shafted by those in power yet again. Think of all the young people out working in retail who will have to wait months for a vaccine because middle age professionals who WFH (comfy in their own homes I might add) will be get the jab first
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar You are going in circles. Teachers, by the nature of their work environments, are at a higher risk of exposure than the gen population. Exposure can lead to death even in younger adults. Many people also have underlying health conditions but are unaware of it. Also, Long Covid.
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar @HSELive The teacher is far more likely than you to catch the disease. Ergo, he/she should get the vaccine ahead of you. So selfish of you to expect young essential workers on the frontline to risk their health so you can you be 100% safe &amp; comfortable in your home.
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar They shouldn't have any other close contacts other than their own household. That's the whole point of Level 5 lockdown we are enduring!
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Because I love my job, chose it pre-pandemic and I have bills to pay. That is such a stupid fucking q. I am actually in cohort 7 so I will be prioritised. I'm arguing for my colleagues because I see the daily reality of the classroom and how social distancing is impossible.
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Why were young healthcare workers vaccinated if exposure doesn't count?
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar But healthcare workers are high risk? After the elderly and vulnerable, we must protect those who are at highest risk of exposure to the virus to a) reduce transmission and overall risk to the population and b) protect essential services and those who provide them to the country.
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Yes. In person.
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar @HSELive At 40, you run a very low risk of dying from Covid (0.4%). At 26, the teacher runs a similarly low risk (0.2%). In the real world, the teacher is much more likely than you to get infected as you work from home. Therefore, he/she is also more likely to die.
===
Here is the thinking that I honestly think is happening behind closed doors with Govt, NPHET and NIAC re young people getting infected with Covid-19. "If there is no consequence then is it a risk?" https://t.co/hVYubs5Z7G
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar But education staff are also at high risk of exposure to the virus due to nature of our work. Much more than anyone WFH. Also, death is not the only factor here. Long Covid cannot be neglected and the impact it could have on organ damage and future life expectancy/quality.
===
@McDonaghDJ @skywalkerchief @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Tell Government that. I'm fine with teachers and SNAs not getting priority if schools are closed until September (and all staff fully vaccunated by then), but I think it would be an absolute travesty to make the mistake of not valuing education as the essential service that it is
===
@skywalkerchief @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Residual risks are risks that cannot be removed, but the amount of long covid can by targeting transmission instead of just death. We need to get the numbers down. You cant just let the virus rip through the young and expect us to pay for it for years to come. Not a residual risk
===
@McDonaghDJ @skywalkerchief @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Govt, NPHET and NIAC do not care about young people whatsoever. They have been completely shafted by the older generation in power time and time again. First it was the housing crisis and now they could care less about the virus ripping through the young and impact of Long Covid.
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar @HSELive But you went to work ?? a complete contradiction if you perceive there to be a risk , and i am stupid
===
@higginsdavidw @CSOIreland Always surprised me that they never put a total amount to be vaccinated in each group , what are they measuring percentage of completion off ??
===
@ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews PLEASE PLEASE ask for solid evidence as to why @ronan_glynn deemed it advisable that underage sports was too risky to return until may and then only for U13's , where is the solid consequentail evidence that this did indeed increase hospitalisation &amp; ICU cases https://t.co/A5icw6AjGS
===
@NewstalkFM Israel üáÆüá± why ?
===
@Followthescien3 @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 a self assessment not medical assessment
===
@rtenews Israel üáÆüá±??? Why
===
@McDonaghDJ @Irish_Memes_ @LeoVaradkar It can be based on the severity of the consequence of being exposed to the risk (exposure) we know this to be age &amp; medical vulnerability. That can increase the likeklihood of the person from dying.
===
@TJRyan_77 https://t.co/Tt2FyO9Kzk Do you not concur with the WHO ?? OR do you perceive to know more than them about it
===
@geraldmbarry Agree , i would however agree going with age as a means to reduce severity / impact. but within those age cohorts identify those who are most exposed (likelihood) and prioritise those first when vaccinating each age cohort. A category within a category so to speak.
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar You can control residual risks. If there is no consequence to a risk then is it a risk ?
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar @HSELive OH for fusk sake !!!! how many times does a teacher need to be told !!! ITS BASED ON SEVERITY OF CONSEQUENCE !!! age and medical vulneribility. Your risks of dying doesnt increase if those arent a factor just cause your exposed!!! JESUS WEPT !!!
===
@DorothyBreen2 @aoifemcl @simoncoveney @killeen_gerry @astaines @pjcoogan @niamh_dr @OisinO_Connell @drdoireann @BrianKiely2 @IrishTimes Honest question @DorothyBreen2 . Do you think pharma companies and those who created the vaccine cant alter it to suit variants ?
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Agree to some extent however if its GAA or soccer it doesnt matter in relation to risk. Its a sports activity outdoors conducted by children. The risk for this is low. very low in fact. Teachers &amp; coaches need to comply equally more so for some teachers as they are indoors
===
@dazult_pdempsey @geraldmbarry Yes thanks i work in Health &amp; Safety so i am aware of the hierarchy of controls or the general principles of prevention.
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar But i thought you could die ?
===
@killeen_gerry @TweetsbySimone @LVADublinPubs Lol you still selling that auld chestnut
===
@COVID19DataIE Are these the dreaded Paddys day swabs ?? 14 days since ?? if so we have done pretty well considering the last two days. No doubt RTE will link both tomorrow
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn There is huge confusion, or misunderstanding of how this virus works and the risk around it to you and others. Thats the confusion. Your technically asking every child to stay indoors or not meet any other kids ? outdoors on indoors !!!
===
@Siobhan60384749 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews Genuine question are teachers always moaning or is it just on twitter ??
===
@Irish_Memes_ 1.Firstly thanks for my first retweet , secondly some context. Hazard - Risk - Risk Rating (Severity &amp; Likelihood) - Risk mitigation - Control measures -  Residual Risk rating - Further control measures. IF there is no consequence of exposure to the risk i.e. see example below
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar @HSELive Lol imagine a teacher who perceives themselves to be at risk of any consequence of a virus , on a mission on twitter for justice but then goes to work TO EXPOSE  himself to the exact thing they are saying is unsafe HOLY FUCK !!! https://t.co/W30b9G95vv
===
@caulmick @RoisinShortall Slightly confused here as exposure is the risk ? the hazard is Covid and the risk is exposure / transmission. Severity of outcome is measured by age and health (vulnerable) , i am presuming she means Likelihood of exposure to the risk.
===
@irishexaminer He believed a lot of other things aswell ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Talking his way out of a job like that other loop de loop in Dublin
===
@GarrettSCassidy @RobertBreslin1 @COVID19DataIE 110k delivered last night early morning today , and i think it was 1.1 million delivered not administered.
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Wow thank god my kids arent being thought by you is all i can say. A complete ignorance to everything going on and the facts , i cant even say a selfish approach as you chose to put yourself at risk . Ignorance is bliss
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar @HSELive No the selfishness is on your behalf your implying every teacher has a high severity consequence which simply isnt true. From day one we have known older people die , 90% of people in ireland who died werent teachers they were medically vulnerable or over 65 !!!
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar But it is a residual risk as a consequence of infection , your then implying that contracting covid or the failure to stop anyone from contracting covid is criminal negligence.
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Yes i do agree and imagine especially in younger kids that getting them to social distance is very hard. However hard and frustrating that may be it is reducing the likelihood of transmission.
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn i live in a medium size town so i see parks and playgrounds full everyday. If like before they were deemed to be "unsafe" then they would be closed. You'll be probably shocked to hear this but an uncontrolled playground or park increases the risk more than controlled training
===
@caulmick Cant but agree with @alankellylabour here , i have 0 political swing here as i despise them all equally but he is simple saying out loud what the majority of the country are thinking. @DonnellyStephen is being incompetent, not doing your homework coming into the dail is shocking
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar You'll not like hearing this but generalising all teachers as being high risk is technically not correct unless they are all the same age, medical history, in the exact same buildings, teaching the same age groups etc. You said all exposure can lead to death though ?
===
@DonnellyStephen Only about 6 months to late but i suppose better late than never ...... not expecting this to materialise into anything but another clusterf*7k but anyway a start i suppose
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn If you are in Cohort 4 then you shouldnt be working, it also means the risk assessment your so flippantly disregarding is something you havent read , cause i am sure if you read it it would clearly state based on your condition not be working. You should seek additional advise
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn No i am trying to focus on real life instead of a facebook timeline , apologies as i sense your probably a teacher and you feel aggrieved but i dont live life via a facebook profile i base it on whats in front of my face.
===
@IrishTimes An absolute disgrace , considering they have never published any consequential evidence to justify these outlandish pieces of advise , where is the evidence that when sports for children were open it increased hospitalisation and ICU ??
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn In regards to consequence of severity yes &amp; we can measure severity based on two categories age and vulnerability. In relation to transmission numbers and categorisation how do you know they arent accurate ? where is your basis around this?
===
@NTBreakfast @petercosgrove @irishcongress welcome to the 21st century Ireland !!!
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar @HSELive Best of luck on your crusade !!! Not long to wait anyhow as we will all be vaccinated by summer anyway. I'll send you a copy :) https://t.co/dvEbCVj08a
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 do i see the glass filling up :) it will be half full soon !!!
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Ok firstly tracing is a control measure. Or in the case of COVID risk mitigation. Whether that works or not doesnt mean the risk assessment isnt needed? Test Track &amp; Trace is in place based on a risk assessment. Without a risk assessment this concept wouldnt exist
===
@VickiMahony @Irish_Memes_ @ISAGCOVID19 Genuine Question Vicki , do you not trust the vaccines ? &amp; do you not think despite one of the greatest achievements in mankind in creating the vaccine that they cant be altered to combat a variant ? not a new virus but a variant?
===
@aoifemcl 1.There is so much wrong in this its hard to make sense what you're trying to say. Indiviual risk is a product of both exposure and vulnerability ... what seriously what !! the exposure to the hazard is the risk !! being vulnerable increases the severity of the exposure
===
@Alex_on_A14 @GabrielScally @ONS yes i saw that , its a self assessment though not a medical one though. I am presuming that if they were medically examined then those figures could change. Also why cant 12 weeks be deemed recovery?
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn you're still trawling on social media though ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è which is causing anxiety otherwise why bring it up as a reason to dismiss kids sports ? how did you know about it in the first place ? üòÜüòÜüòÜ from looking at social media
===
@DebbieHalliday3 @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Thanks debbie however a group of specialists discussing what should be done for something that hasnt been medically determined yet isnt evidence. We ask for medical evidence to test positive for COVID why not for Long COVID
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar @HSELive Hard to support you there kid cause thats just dumb a complete contradiction of everything you stand for
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Do you genuinely think that narrowminded or are you just frustrated by a handfull of stories in the news of vaccine queue jumping. Do you genuinely think all people who WFH sit at their desk 24/7 and have no other contacts ??
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Yup i imagine the truth hurts alright :)
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 so when is the new hospitalisation surge coming then ???
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Then you have made a conscious decision. I am confused though on one hand you say teaching is at high risk but on the other hand you go to work despite being in cohort 4 but blame everyone else for their risk perception not being the same as yours ?? very confusing
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar @HSELive So have you now changed the narrative of the pandemic , so it isnt about reducing hospital capacity to allow other treatment to continue but not its to eliminate long covid , i am confused?
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn i am not manipulating anything , you descibes someone who is anxious because they saw something which makes them anxious , if you're trawling your students social media pages then i would imagine thats a higher level of anxiety. Sorry
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Your generalising teaching as a high risk. Every teachers risk exposure is unique. Unless every teacher was the same age, medical condition , in the exact same room or building , teaching the same age group &amp; given the exact same PPE or control measure the risk differs
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Long Covid is a residual risk along with alot of other residual risks. We likely wont see the long term effects of that for years to come.

@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn same advise.
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 There you go !!!! so please wake up and stop scaremongering , i understand your upset that this will all be over soon and you'll find yourself questioning yourself why you were so wrong but i promise i wont hold it against all the scaremongering morbid chasers https://t.co/1DapgH1was
===
@Alex_on_A14 @LongCovidFight @GabrielScally @ONS potentially it is but self assessments isnt medical assessments so therefore cant be determined fully. I am not undermining this at all just wondering why we need medical confirmation that someone has covid but dont when we talk about long covid
===
@Followthescien3 @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 your funny :)
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 oh here comes the glass half empty again !!! there are 650,000 people in ireland over 65 they even at this rate will be vaccinated with a first jab minimum by may so any increase on the quantity we have now will be great , done and dusted by the summer
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Confused here , are you saying teachers are engaged in activities that ramp up transmission ? or are you saying teaching as a profession is classed as a high exposure profession ?

@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar So that they reduce the risk of transmission to someone who's severity of exposure to the risk is high.
===
@FergalBowers @rtenews How did they identify them in the first place , where did they come up with the 150,000 to 250,000 number ??
===
@Irish_Memes_ @Joannemurfi @McDonaghDJ @LeoVaradkar Of course someone working from home with less contacts is less likely to catch it. In what context do you mean exposure counts ?? as in dying from it ? Young healthcare workers were vaccinated to reduce the risk of transmission as they are exposed on a regular basis

===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Thats incorrect , just cause your exposure level is higher doenst mean your risk of dying increases it increases the likelihood of transmission , severity of that consequence is based on age , vulneribility and now potentially vaccination and immunisation.
===
@Joannemurfi @McDonaghDJ @Irish_Memes_ @LeoVaradkar Not for everyone , severity is based on age and vulneribility. Now you can add vaccinated and those who have already had it. So just cause your exposed on a large scale it doesnt necessarily mean you'll die from it

===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn If your so concerned for teachers tell me the following then , how many teachers in Ireland and categorise them by age. Then compare those figures to over 65‚Äôs let‚Äôs do that first .
===
@GarrettSCassidy @RobertBreslin1 @COVID19DataIE Yeah they gave +100,000 for this week , currently at 55,000 or there about.
===
@Followthescien3 @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 can you provide the evidence actually of concussion in children in rugby ??
===
@AlienPencil @ScaryTimes2 @Orla_Hegarty I have children and i concur , its also been now stated by NIAC considering they are prioritising the vaccination by age. Median age of cases is 32 and its also not pushing up the hospitalisation or ICU's since the small number of vulnerable have been vaccinated.
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn I just hope you aren‚Äôt a teacher ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn I do as you dont want to hear anything else bar what you think is right , if its any reasurance to you it'll all be over come the summer and i hope you get some help then to ease the anxiety , good luck
===
@Followthescien3 Case numbers arent pushing up hospitalisation or ICU , median age is 32. This would compliment the fact they have now pushed this age cohort down the pecking order. Hence no reason now to concentrate solely on case numbers instead move to hospitalisation. Its a contradiction
===
@archeryclub4 @jlamber55605930 1000000000000000% the risks of not sending your kids to school far outweighs the risk of them becoming ill , hospitalised , ventilated or even tiny margin in ICU
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Also please enlighten me with your indepth knowledge of science why when the median age of cases is 32 , hospitalisation is decreasing , mortality decreasing are young people being moved down the vaccine queue to make way for vulnerable people ??? look forward to your answer
===
@DebbieHalliday3 @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 I never said there wasnt , what i said is that now hospitalisation is decreasing whilst cases increase in turn suggesting that those who are now contracting the virus arent being hospitalised. If you listened to todays HSE briefing you will understand that
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 how can we be as the end of the peak if the cases are going up lol , followthescience seriously change your name its becoming embarrasing now
===
@DebbieHalliday3 @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Can you provide any medical evidence for long Covid ? i would be interested in reading that. Measuring hospitalisation in general by a couple of weeks is inaccurate each case is different.
===
@TJRyan_77 wrong . @laoneill111 is highlighting severity your trying to highlight likelihood of risk exposure. https://t.co/hd2LjMu3oY
===
@GabrielScally @ONS Should this not be classed as long term recovery instead of Long COVID as they technically dont have covid anymore ? especially for those who's residual symptoms only last for 4 weeks ?
===
@1987Andrewk https://t.co/Tt2FyO9Kzk WHO commending it but i suppose you know more
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Apologies i am not i answered the original query and i explained that you cant categorise an entire profession as being high risk as each individual exposure to the risk is different. I also explained about the difference in severity based on exposure. No circles there
===
@ISAGCOVID19 @ReginaDo Honestly lads give up
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn But how do you think risk is determined ?? you cant say on one hand they are being sacrificed and then say mythical risk assessment ?? you obviously just done a risk assessment if you deem the consequence of the risk is sacrifice lol üòÜüòÜ
===
@RobertBreslin1 @GarrettSCassidy @COVID19DataIE HSE press briefing , states 116,000 AZ delivered and 30,000 backlog caught up . 1.187 mill delivered
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 yup and decreasing so whats you point , i just told you there were 270+ in hospital
===
@Alex_on_A14 @LongCovidFight @GabrielScally @ONS Potentially and considering the amount of research around COVID i am sure it will come to light in time
===
@dazult_pdempsey @geraldmbarry Putting my Risk Assessors hat on the chart below shows the importance of age based vaccinations. Shame we cant put in more stringent risk mitigation measures for those frontline workers in the lower age groups,hence why i would prioritise them in within each age group https://t.co/nVmhdQebVm
===
@aoifemcl 2. when you consider the two main factors in dealing with a COVID i.e. the Hazard known from the very very beginning is that those vulnerable (which we know by age and health status) suffer the higher severity of consequence.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @LongCovidFight @GabrielScally @ONS Yeah just brings me back to the same self assessment survey , thanks for looking
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 AH come on this is the third time now !!! did you fail maths in your leaving lol !!! there was also 25 sent home as in healthy , back with their families , cmon have some compassion grim reaper
===
@dazult_pdempsey @geraldmbarry Age isnt a Hazard,age is a contributing factor to the outcome of exposure, you can now measure severity by age. You can/should be then able to increase control measure to prevent likelihood to those who's consequence of exposure to the risk is severe.Risk mitigation b4 control
===
@LongCovidFight @Alex_on_A14 @GabrielScally @ONS Exactly what you say , medical assessments based on medical evidence instead of self assessments
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 No offence but that chart is about as usefull as a ashtray on a motorbike
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Firstly i would ask why are you friends or looking at you're students social media posts , secondly i would potentiall go to your principle and ask he/she that your potentially suffering from anxiety and ask them for time off. Look after yourself first is my advise
===
@VickiMahony Same can be said here , and considering ireland uses more Pfizers vaccine https://t.co/9VIYPVoi4z
===
@mancunianmedic No disrepect but a blog doesnt compare to a large scale self assessment survey to determine medical assessments of long term covid
===
@McDonaghDJ @Irish_Memes_ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar @HSELive I am a 40 yr old WFH employee with no underlying medical conditions . However based on my age i am at more risk of hospitalisation , ICU or death than a 26 year old teacher with no underlying medical conditions. Its as simple as that and there is a years evidence to back it up
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn I havent seen the images you refer to so its hard to make any judgement. I look at risk in a whole which in this case is transmission or exposure. Outdoor activity are low , indoors can be high if control measures havent been implemented. I look at from competency not facebook

@irishexaminer @McConnellDaniel How with a case number median age of 32 , Hospitalisation &amp; ICU not increasing &amp; patients on ventilation decreasing also now moving the median case age group regardless of risk exposure to the bottom of the vaccine roll out . Oh and vaccines being rolled out at 1mill a month ?
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 cases have been rising for day , weeks even , tomorrows will be nearly double todays based on positive swabs but still cases are decreasing in hospitals. Do you not see the median age is 32 . So low they have been bumped way down the list of vaccines , what does that tell you
===
@irishexaminer @McConnellDaniel In this letter @ronan_glynn also advised that no children be allowed play sports until May and only then would U13's be considered , absolutely bonkers !!! https://t.co/z1zJgEtzTQ
===
@Followthescien3 @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 274 &amp; 63 more decreases , this is again more decrease , considering an increase in GP calls , walk in test centres and a big case number today &amp; median age of cases being bumped down the vaccine list means severity is decreasing .... which of course we knew from day 0
===
@irishexaminer it will also mean the narrative must change from measuring everything off case numbers (median age 32). If that age median is at such a risk of creating a 4th wave then why are they not deemed high risk when it comes to vaccine roll out ?
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Ah this is about vaccines. Ok answer me this first , how many teachers in Ireland and SNA's and break them down into age categories. Measure the cases, hospitalisation , ICU &amp; Deaths against those who's vaccines you will be taking. No-one is undevaluing education
===
@newschambers How many of you in the room @newschambers ?? thats an hour indoors now with little or no evidence of mask wearing ?? thought @ronan_glynn &amp; @President_MU said this is the one thing not to do ??

@MaryJ1979 @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 I presume the fact you both are on twitter you've access to google , its great you type something in and it gives you loads of amazing information
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Healthcare workers are high risk as the higher %  of people they are exposed to have covid. To reduce hospitalisation ,ICU &amp; death we need to protect those who when exposed to the risk have a high severity consequence and we know thats age &amp; vulnerability not profession
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn How about living in the real world instead of on facebook lol . Are you like 20 lol
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn I have two kids in school every day &amp; i also have one son that plays sports. I also know that based on the risk kids sporting activities outdoors doesnt pose a risk nor is the % consequence of the risk occuring severe. The residual risks far outweight the actual risk
===
@arseagon @jlamber55605930 if they dont turn to hospitalisation , Ventilation , ICU or death then no , remember the goal is to free up our hospitals . Hospital figures have to become the most important as the vaccine roll out progresses
===
@marcusguntherky @DorothyBreen2 @aoifemcl @simoncoveney @killeen_gerry @astaines @pjcoogan @niamh_dr @OisinO_Connell @drdoireann @BrianKiely2 @IrishTimes The vaccine for COVID is one of the greatest achievements of mankind but many then perceive thats the height of our limitations and that we can alter these to suit a new variant ... a variant not a new virus which of course would put us back to square one.

@irishexaminer @GirlsBadNews More importantly where is the figure for those who were then admitted to hospital ?
===
@jlamber55605930 IF the numbers increase and like we have already seen by the median age of cases it doesnt increase hospitalisation , Ventilation , ICU &amp; Death then we continue to open up along with the vaccine roll out , in turn getting more of our vulnerable vaccinated
===
@aoifemcl 4. Vaccinate those more likely to have high severity consequence from the risk , in turn reduces hospitalisatio n , ICU and death. If you're not in favor of this then you need to question yourself.

===
@arseagon @jlamber55605930 yeah but for how long , with the median age being 32 at the moment with cases and potentially 1 million vaccines in arms of the vulnerable in the next two months , it will be very hard to keep up the case hunt especially if the consequence of them are low
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar I agree in relation to the disregard to children but the virus ripping through the young i dont. If there is no consequence then is it a risk? your assuming Long Covid is applicable to all. I imagine the percentage of people who fully recover outweighs those with long covid
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 HA HA HA the auld glass half empty morbid approach ... there were 25 peope left go home !!!! there are only 41 people on ventilation now &amp; bar the one dead in ICU two others luckily got to get out of ICU so please stop with the morbidity. The glass is half Full !!
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 36 out of 332 are you having a laugh. Look at the vulnerable numbers , once they are vaccinated your still going to be worrying about 36 !!! 
https://t.co/0EWD4GYk3a

@andrewflood @geraldmbarry Are those figures not assumptions based on modelling of different scenarios ? Also when you say outcome risk what is that ? the risk is very much known at this stage do you mean severity of the exposure to the risk ?

@Followthescien3 @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 now we are talking , rugby :) love it played it all my life so , please please enlighten me how you have come to such conclusion that long covid and concussion in children are the same or can be compaired ?
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 hence my original point that as vaccinations progress and case numbers dont materialise into hospitalisations then there is no point chasing cases but concentrating on the hospitalisation numbers ... bloody hell your one of the harder nutjobs on here!!!
===
@Orla_Hegarty @theonemanzone The vaccine change by NIAC could imply we arent all as vulnerable as you perceive. If if been rolled out by age then that also is done based on vulnerability . Its also not an unknown disease its highly likely the most researched disease in such a short space of time
===
@dazult_pdempsey @geraldmbarry thats purely based on now as in right now :)
===
@dazult_pdempsey @geraldmbarry 2. Thats also despite large volumes of GP calls based on people with symptoms &amp; increased testing with walk in facilities now open. Swab positivity rate is also low. It does point to what we knew from day one and thats old people get more severe consequence than younger
===
@muinteoirmama @dazult_pdempsey @geraldmbarry Apologies I believe teachers should only have been prioritised on the vaccination list to allow schools reopen.Not on their likelihood to be exposed to the risk. Can i ask you how many teachers are in Ireland &amp; what the age categories are? i genuinely dont know
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn I do remember. You can flip that i would imagine aswell for example my sons teacher had covid and came to school ,the entire class of junior infants had to get tested , non compliance wll exist in all profession , but it doesnt mean the risks are different
===
@rtenews it must now mean the narrative must change from measuring everything off case numbers (median age 32). If that age median is at such a risk of creating a 4th wave then why are they not deemed high risk when it comes to vaccine roll out ?
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Ok so two things , firstly why ? considering you perceive large exposure to be at risk of dying regardless of condition such as age and medical history.

Secondly where you involved in your classrooms risk assessment ?
===
@IrishTimes Confused by this headline , why should that matter in a country with 0 covid ? i am sure they have all the time they want to roll it out
===
@AL89659561 @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn I work in health and safety for over 20 years , risk assessment isnt a vague term it is the term to identify risk. There are many forms of RA but ultimately all have the same purpose , i am surprised you dont understand that when you have a hazard you would risk assess it
===
@dazult_pdempsey @geraldmbarry You could argue the entire country wasnt provided with proper mitigation measures for a year. The gamble of solely relying on 5mill people to social distance was obsurd considering risk perception would always differ. Only now are we seeing other forms of mitigation measures
===
@Irish_Memes_ @McDonaghDJ @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar Out of curiosity are you still teaching ?
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 where is the evidence of long covid , how long after infection can you medically determine someone has any long lasting or life lasting effects?

@Followthescien3 @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Ok if i told you you were covid positive would you believe me ? just for clarity i am not a doctor or a medical professional
===
@paulsmith_1111 @Followthescien3 @gavreilly Interesting to see will the narrative change on chasing case numbers now in regards to this change considering the median of case numbers is 32. If they dont need the only control measure out there to protect them from the risk then how much of a risk does that age group pose?
===
@Irish_Memes_ 2. If i am in a low age cohort with no underlying medical conditions and i contract Covid,i make a full recovery. Then the severity or consequence of exposure to the hazard is 0. Then were is the consequential risk to this individual ? Not everyone has a high severity consequence
===
@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 44% will be by June , remembering 250,000 people have already had covid and there are 24% of the population children. Tonight the hospitals are down to 272 thats 25 in one day ICU down to 64 . Thats with according to NPHET on the brink of a 4th wave. we live in ireland simple

@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 why is basing it on fact not enough ???
===
@aoifemcl 3.And the fact that the control measure for this hazard which reduces severity to practically 0 is the vaccine. Then it only makes sense to vaccinate by age , there is staggering amounts of evidence to suggest this.
===
@higginsdavidw He is also wrong , @laoneill111 is correctly highlighting severity of exposure to the risk whereas @TJRyan_77 is correcting him on Likelihood of exposure two very different things when looking at that graph. It‚Äôs clearly showing severity consequences based on age

@Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 That doesnt work as we have seen cases increase from 250-300 to 600 (tomorrow possible over 700) so where is the increase or better still when is the surge of hospitalisations coming , you are aware of the median age and vaccinations correct ???
===
@aoifemcl It‚Äôs been known from day zero that older people are at a far higher risk than younger people . What part don‚Äôt you get ???
===
@kierancuddihy @kierancuddihy it should also be a indicator to change the narrative around chasing cases (median age of 32). If this change was made to prioritise vaccination based on risk v age then we should stop following cases and report instead on Hospitalisation &amp; ICU.

@Irish_Memes_ @skywalkerchief @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar The government knows about the option of closing schools because it closed them already after Christmas.
===
@Irish_Memes_ @skywalkerchief @Joannemurfi @LeoVaradkar There is an option of closing schools for a period of time, which has been exercised twice in Ireland during this #pandemic. You can't close hospitals &amp; you can't keep hospitals going if most of the staff are self-isolating.

@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn In all these exchanges, the views I have put forward are precisely the reason why training for outdoor sports is currently held back for children. It's not just me being a crazed over-anxious teacher. It's a pandemic measure, and I hope it is upheld while it's still risky.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn "meet other kids" is the issue. As well acknowledged, and as the very sensible decision to hold off on outdoor sports for now attests to.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Have you forgotten what my comments were about? My point is: you cannot have, running in parallel, schools where teachers are working really hard at keeping transmission levels low, while coaches have groups of kids mixing &amp; then attending school.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Reality as a teacher is having the children tell you what they have done the days previous, and then seeing pics on Facebook of non-socially distanced behaviour, as you're reminding them the next day to step back so as to leave some space between them and the other child in front
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn As regards my anxiety levels, that's again manipulating the situation to shift blame onto teachers. It's saying: "we're going to place you in a high level of risk, and if you don't like it you're being over-anxious." When really my point is: keep that risk level low. No sports.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Oh, you probably live in a bigger town. I don't have to go looking for these pics, since our community is a ... community, and I happen to be part of it.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn You do not know the actual risk, since in many instances CC are not identified in schools &amp; transmission is deemed community transmission.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn My point is that GAA training is not a "profession". Although we both know it's really important for some kids, if school is deemed essential right now, the important GAA training has to remain suspended. Unless   coaches are prepared to work as hard as teachers SD the children.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn The "risk assessment" argument is used to tell me that well, yes, all that is going on, but that's all absolutely fine because "risk assessment". I'm in category 4 by the way, and I still have to be teaching Mikey, unvaccinated.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Ok, so now picture that I am telling Mikey to SD from his friend, while I have seen a pic of Mikey's sister non SDing last week at sports with children from another school where there was an outbreak.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn I love my job, I am needed there, and if restrictions are upheld, I am happy to keep working. If sports outside of school takes place and increases that risk for me (and all others in the school), it's a problem. Nothing confusing here.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn No, I simply have no time for this kind of trolling anymore. I will not engage in roundabouts conversations on a mythical "risk assessment" that asserts that it's ok to sacrifice one section of the population. It's a pandemic.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn You cannot have one section of the population working hard at stamping down transmission while factions are engaging in activities that can ramp up transmission. And then decide that it's tough *hit for the first ones because "risk assessment".
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn How can you have a risk assessment when close contacts are underestimated, and when tracing is insufficient for the few deemed close contacts? For risk assessment that is not mysterious or mythical, you need numbers that are trustworthy.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn I have no sympathy for this. All other gatherings were ruled out, teachers were working really hard daily to keep Covid at bay, &amp; yet coaches couldn't be arsed trying to enforce a modicum of social distancing. Tracing can't tell you what cases resulted from that.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn You know what ? when training was still allowed for the children, there was a steady stream of pics on my Facebook of them (and adults) posing after matches/training sessions with absolutely no social distancing. Maybe that's why.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Risk assessment is such a vague term that it is conveniently posited to wave off restrictions on some to the detriment of others. Maybe I should have said "mysterious" instead of mythical. You cannot risk assess either way when the tracing is so inefficient.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn I have to go myself, you know, get off social media and all that. You should do that too by the way. Twitter IS social media.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn You know what transient means right ?
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn And as I mentioned above, there was clear evidence on my Facebook timeline of non-compliance, in parallel to school happening. You're focusing in trying to semantically twisting things while I'm looking at reality here.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn You see that's why I tend to not engage. Oh wait, I already said that. I am glad outdoor sports are being held back for now.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Categorisation is very important to assess risk to teachers, SNAs, children, and their families. The numbers published about schools are not accurate if you classify school transmission as community transmission.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn Nope. You do your own little maths contortions to justify whatever is on your agenda. I'll stick to the grown up version of dealing with a pandemic.
===
@skywalkerchief @ZaraKing @VirginMediaNews @ronan_glynn The definition of CC in school is not the same as elsewhere &amp; tracing only goes back 2 days. Therefore the transmission from Paddy who attended sports the week before is highly likely to be recorded as community transmission down the line.

@skywalkerchief @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Apologies...meant to say professional rugby players and it's correlation to brain injury in later life..i was reading something else as I was typing that
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 But that document doesn't refute the fact that 16 people were admitted today and 4 to ICU....that's one day
===
@skywalkerchief @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 It's not a good argument to say..there is no definitive and absolute proof therefore let's dismiss the concerns of experts in the field
===
@LouisWu1992 @skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Proportionately more people leave hospital than die...thankfully!.....so I think that was the argument but I can't say for sure
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 These waves have followed the same pattern..first increased cases..then increased hospitalistion and death...remember in November when we were the best in Europe? Recent evidence from Canada showed an increase in school age children preceded their current wave
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Look at the hospitalisations table...a significant number of those who have been hospitalised are under 65...so it's logical to say that if you allow if to run through the under 65's while unvaccinated you will end up with significant hospitalisations
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Incorrect..many discharged from hospital take significant time to recover afterwards...by that logic if there were 6 people in a car crash and 4 lived but 2 died that would be fine because you would be +2ü§¶

@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 vaccinated

===
@LouisWu1992 @skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 as we navigate our way out

This is interesting

Although evidence is a bit dated

https://t.co/GlpgdsJeZT
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Also, trying to twist my words doesn't prove a point...I never said there would be a surge right now...in fact I accounted for the current trend..the surge happens a couple of weeks after you hit exponential growth
===
@skywalkerchief @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 A very good example of this is concussion in professional  rugby and it's potential correlation with brain degeneration in later life...obviously we don't have 70 year olds that we can longitudinally track back to their playing days...but neurosurgeons can still flag this as a
===
@LouisWu1992 @skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 I agree...I think that this type of thinking is sometimes framed as negative..when in fact it is the opposite...we can see the path out..what is frustrating is that there are many who don't want to choose that path or take shortcuts...or provide the necessary protections
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Due to vaccination it is not likely that a surge would be anything like the winter one...and we aren't going to significantly reduce restrictions...but we would see significant hospitalisations if there was exponential growth and that is absolutely possible with such a small %
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Yes but we need a significant level of vaccination for that...and that is at least a few months down the road at current rates..the government are full of promises regards vaccinations..but then there always seems to be a bump in the road or an excuse
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 I think the vaccine is amazing...the issue is it will take months to roll out here and we need to be careful...a number of countries have already made the mistake of opening too quickly
===
@skywalkerchief @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Explained above
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 There's around 170 patients under 65 hospitalised right now
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Hopefully it won't with proper management..look at France tonight
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 I don't think there is a definitive answer...but it is something that more and more evidence is emerging on
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 There were 16 admissions today...that;s over 100 a week...and you are taking daily figures to compare changes which is incorrect...there hasn't been such dramatic shifts in 7 day rolling averages
===
@skywalkerchief @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 The issue is that you can't have longitudinal evidence for something as new as covid...but there are plenty examples of where this difficulty applies across many situations in science and medicine
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 It's decreasing because we are at the end of a peak but there are new admissions every day...as I said 16 today and 4 to ICU while we are in the midst of severe restrictions
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 we roll out vaccine
===
@skywalkerchief @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Because it is a long term illness...therefore longitudinal studies are the type of evidence you are looking for and this is not there simply because of time scale...absence of evidence is not evidence of absence
===
@skywalkerchief @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 No but if I had symptoms I would go to a medical professional for their opinion..it is medical professionals that are flagging long covid..not just random people saying they don't feel better after covid
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Because we are coming down from a huge wave...there is no guarantee that those numbers will continue to decrease..in fact if cases rise they will go up again..how do we know? There are plenty of examples of fourth waves happening in Europe and worldwide right now
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Our case numbers stabilised a few weeks ago but they are starting to trend up again....this is a similar pattern in Europe and most epidemiologists have characterized it as a fourth wave (not one long continuous one)...that is why discharges are higher right now
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 ü§¶.....we only have 4% of the population vaccinated and there are still hospital admissions currently...they are just decreasing overall as we were coming down from such a big number..and with all due respect saying that evidence from any other country is irrelevant is ridiculous
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 The overall caseload from the last wave caused a large surge in hospital numbers...since we have been in lockdown this has been slowly reducing..in the same way that cases precede a wave , case numbers decline after a wave before hospitalisation numbers fall
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Cases stalled approximately 2 weeks ago..they started to tick up again in the last couple of weeks with school opening...you won't see a dramatic increase until you hit exponential growth
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 What do you mean there you go? 16 people were admitted to hospital and 4 to ICU in the last 24 hours...and we are in the middle of a severe lockdown...
===
@skywalkerchief @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 18 new admissions to hospital today
2 new admissions to ICU
31 released from hospital (as explained previously- thankfully most are released and it is entirely expected that given the size of the last wave and where we currently are releases exceed admissions for the moment)
===
@MaryJ1979 @skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Exactly...those who have already had it will still need to be vaccinated and children can still spread it
===
@LouisWu1992 @skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Although the evidence in it is a quite dated
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 And there is nothing wrong with optimism...and we are on the way out...we just want to make sure we do it in the right way...

Also we know the vaccine is vulnerable to certain strains....so keeping community transmission low stops the possibility of one getting a foothold while
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 I already have and it's better if you can make your own arguments
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 However if cases were to continue to increase , or if they increased at a faster pace, then we would see a turnaround in hospitalisations...as they have done in many countries that are ahead of us on vaccine rollout
===
@skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 332 people hospitalised...many in younger age groups https://t.co/ZKMDCrO9TW
===
@skywalkerchief @DebbieHalliday3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 potential issue based on what we know...and no scientist will tell you to wait for absolute definitive evidence in cases like this...the evidence is based on cross sectional data and applying what we know to this
===
@skywalkerchief @GabrielScally @ONS No not necessarily, there may still be persistent virus in the body that is triggering inflammation and other issues but not enough to be infectious
===
@skywalkerchief @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 So there can be a lag between positive cases and hospitalisations.
===
@skywalkerchief @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 The evidence is in the actual damage to the body through scans and blood tests etc. Covid is one disease so tests can detect is, but  there are several ways people can be damaged by the virus, so likely there couldn't be one specific test for long covid.
===
@skywalkerchief @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Hospitalisations and deaths are not the only figures we should be concerned with. Long Covid is happening in all age groups, children who have it have organ damage which they may never recover from. 
Also, hospitalisations tend to occur a couple of weeks after someone becomes ill
===
@skywalkerchief @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 There are believed to be several reasons that people may continue to be ill, including autoimmune problems, organ damage and reservoirs of disease being present in people for a long time. Finding a single diagnosic or test in this case could be very difficult.

@skywalkerchief @Alex_on_A14 @GabrielScally @ONS What medical evidence exactly would suffice? The medical world is so new to dealing with Long Covid, an illness with multiple organ systems affected, and some patients not even having a diagnosis due to lack of awareness in medical profession.

@skywalkerchief @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 What happens in other countries is very relevant. But that aside, case numbers have started to climb and we're starting wave 4 because of inaction by govt to stem the rise. Hospitalisations and deaths will follow, as they always do.
===
@skywalkerchief @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 There were also 700 positive swabs today. The trend is upward. People get covid, then some get sick, then some go to hospital, then some go to ICU and some die, then some die in ICU. Hospitalisations and deaths follow infections as sure as night follows day. Y don't U understand?

@Followthescien3 @skywalkerchief @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Okay. It isn't time to _focus_ on hospitalisations though. Certainly we should consider them, but with a new wave kicking off, we need to focus more on cases. With long covid and the possibility of longer term ill-effects, hospitalisations are not a good metric to base policy on.
===
@skywalkerchief @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 Including the fact that previous infection doesn't preclude a person from being reinfected?
===
@skywalkerchief @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 What's the 250k got to do with it?
===
@skywalkerchief @Followthescien3 @MorgenrothEdgar @jlamber55605930 So those infected last Yr prior to September no longer have immunity?
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis -&gt; As for my friend Dave, he's a compulsive liar who's suffering from delusions of grandeur. Have a look at these tweets and see if you find his ramblings convincing. And I haven't even mentioned anything about his glorious Amway past... https://t.co/5WNVxmyzFo
===
@Alex_on_A14 @slodge @greg_travis That's not the point here, though? Anyway, just keep in mind that Dave's "facts" don't always add up. He's definitely not clueless, but he's got his own weird axe to grind, that's all I'm saying.
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis I see you've already discovered the Amway story. üòÄ

I don't know what Dave's angle is, but he is hellbent on skewing facts regarding the Swedish strategy. This is what his profile looked like before the pandemic, btw. And now he's a "public health epidemiologist"? üòµüòê https://t.co/eYRBTOUs6p
===
@Alex_on_A14 @slodge @greg_travis Ask him about him buying face masks in January, how he hosted guests from Wuhan (!) in February/March (even though it was in lockdown then), how he and his entire family managed to get covid-19 twice (!) (in spite of face masks). Etc, etc. The man is a mythomaniac, unfortunately.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @slodge @greg_travis Well, during last spring I think they had to use helicopter service for a handful of patients. Nothing like that now. I believe there are certain regions that are close to full capacity, however, but coordination seems to work well.
===
@Alex_on_A14 @slodge @greg_travis Here are the figures for the whole country. Currently 18 % free ICU capacity. With regional differences obviously. More people admitted to hospital during the second way, fewer in ICU wards - better treatments and people admitted earlier. https://t.co/UQLPC3GPgs
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis Yes, Dave's been pissing me off quite a bit, but I'm not really a troll. Promise. Dave's a charlatan who claims he's had SARS, that his entire family has been reinfected by covid-19and that he's suffering from long covid. Here are the figures for Stockholm -&gt; https://t.co/hO5QwRt2MJ
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis No, the plan for the Stockholm region was that this particular hospital wouldn't accept any more patients. For some reason the ambulances turned up anyway and had to be redirected to other hospitals. The regional hospital director in the clip says that the situation during -&gt;
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis -&gt; the Saturday was actually looking better than the Friday and that there was available ICU capacity. Dave spun it to make it sound like the end is nigh. 

Yes, I'm trying to improve on the personal attacks part, but Dave has pissed me off for so long, it's not easy to let go...
===
@slodge @Alex_on_A14 @greg_travis Peak ICU occupancy is March/April last year: approx. 220. Current occupancy: approx. 80. Situation is still serious, though and the curves are going in the wrong direction. -&gt;

@skywalkerchief @IrishTimes This is terrible. How can it be justified. I‚Äôve complied with everything. I‚Äôve set up systems in my service to work with COVID - why can the same not apply to clubs and sports. Getting very frustrated now at the lack of effort.

I'm still grooving on the idea of a Call of Cthulhu campaign based on the Baker Street Irregulars where you play as an expendable Street kid  in a struggle against otherworldly forces.
