Dice tower felting went faster than expected. The adhesive backed felt really speeds things up. Went ahead and glued it up. Applied rubber bands so it all goes together straight. Leave it overnight then remove the bands. Then we're done.

Dice tower designed, &amp; laser cut (thanks @ponokohq).  5th experimental one. Design works fine &amp; now testing with assembly. Bamboo veneer, with cherry stain. And had my d20 logo laser-etched to see how that worked out. #dicetower #DnD https://t.co/COM6aXGcMd

Today we felt the new dice tower. Does it need it? No, but it really softens the sound of dice rolling. I've used brused on, and spray on glues and in the end? Self-adhesive felt works just as well and is MUCH easier to trim and apply. #dicetower #dnd #rpgs #dungeonsanddragons https://t.co/SW8c7NTA4K

@Snakesandlattes I found your cafes via the DiceTower years ago. The cafes look lovely. I hope to visit someday. I live in Japan.

I believe you sell games at your venue? I'm an indy designer and publisher and I'm looking for retail opportunities.

Who should I talk to?

One thing I like about using these clamps is that it gives the pieces a nice carrier handle

@EmberFirehair Dunno about the X-men one but the base game is getting great reviews.  The top complaint was always ‚Äòneeds more‚Äô.

FWIW I have the all-in on the previous kickstarter and the chibis are AWESOME, look forward to painting them.

Look at this Laser Engraved DND logo! Good thing we woke Pixel up for this.
