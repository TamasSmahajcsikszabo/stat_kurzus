To me, I really can‚Äôt compare the two because they‚Äôre so wildly different between the story, characters, &amp; genre. They‚Äôre in the same universe that‚Äôs it.

That‚Äôd be like saying ‚Äúwhich is a better movie Booksmart or Hereditary?‚Äù You can‚Äôt compare them they have nothing in common! https://t.co/tPXVKi60Yo

@MBeckett_VO @Chuck_Huber @catprotanoVA @MikeCiporkin @TomAglioVO As a voice actor, two. One good one for your VO services in the genre/niche you serve, and one alt for the "about me" section of your website. :0)

@DarkoMarx Not for me, no. I figured out pretty early on that it wasn‚Äôt that type of movie. But I do think that‚Äôs a fair criticism of the film. They built expectations for one genre of film and it was the total opposite.

Seriously.

@NitishSahoo3 @milanluthria Milan is the most underrated director in film industry. @RajkumarHirani is called the top most director, but, fact is he works only with super stars &amp; mostly only one genre of social comedy.

Pros: Hanzo/Bi-Han, give me that movie

@YunggReaper I bet! I can't wait to see it dude. I'd rather not compare it with the Superhero CBM genre because this movie is going to be completely different from a CBM.

@jforn11 Just because it's a genre film, that doesn't mean it's immune to criticism.

Never understood why people expect genre movies to be some kind of cinema game changer. I hold Movies like sonic, fast and the furious, tomb raider etc etc to an completely different standard than I would an indie movie or something like Tenet. It‚Äôs a popcorn movie .

@skipbolden Not bad. Probably one of the best of the genre. 
That type of movie has not aged well, too many cheap imitations have spoiled the plot. Thankfully a talented cast and director still keep up the interest.

@KyleNeubeck Marvel/Superhero movies are spectacles not cinema. Every so often you get the rare one that transcends the Genre like TDK.

There‚Äôs a lot of movie in  #TheEmptyMan... too much in fact... it‚Äôs ambitious and brilliant in parts, so well acted, directed and is so close to a modern horror masterpiece- but it‚Äôs a lot... really hope all those involved stay in the genre though

Mortal Kombat is not a Flawless Victory but is another step in the right direction for the genre.

If you just want fighting and gore, then this movie mostly delivers. Despite the deep character, dialogue and story flaws, the untapped franchise potential is there.

@ShowmaxOnline Honestly, I don‚Äôt think this is an individual problem. Your interface is just simply user unfriendly. You cannot search by genre. directors, actresses. Just to find a movie you have to travel the high seas. Netflix can help you find a movie at the tip of your tongue... like ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

In typical movie making or storytelling, especially when starting in a franchise, you need to accept that not everyone in the theater, house, or wherever you watch your movies, is a fan of the franchise or genre your film is based on. They are there not for the fan service...

#TheFalconAndTheWinterSoldier ends today ---- here's my essay on how the Disney+ series engaged with the tropes of its genre: the 'Buddy Cop' movie. For @firstpost

It sucks that if MORTAL KOMBAT isn't successful the cast is likely going to tagged with that when they maybe New Line Cinema shouldn't have hired a first-time director for a video game adaptation when the genre is known for rushed/cheap feature films.
===
Sometimes things that seem very trivial are most difficult to execute. For example, comedy is the most difficult genre for an actor, and erotica is the most difficult genre for a writer.

‚ÄúIn our conversations, the director often mentioned the elements of the film noir and I liked the concept of telling a contemporary story through the means of the old-time genre.‚Äù Ieva Marija Baranauskaitƒó. https://t.co/ACQdG8ysBZ

@caliconamu FCK YEAH as it /SHOULD/ there's a reason why this movie basically kick started its own trope genre. Being drift compatible is so dhdkdk, like bro, this movie is just ppl powering up huge ass robots on the strength of their relationship and the trust they have for each other plsüò≠

that's a huge lie gang, I just really like the Mortal Kombat IP because I'm a big sucker for the genre Ninja vs. Movie Star vs. Cowboy vs. Lizard Person vs. Demon vs. Wizard vs. Whatever
plus the cast is stacked as hell with great physical actors and stunt performers

@Zhane_Star I want to say Mars Attacks, but that's too easy and I grew up on that.

That's okay though because Where The Dead Go to Die exists, and it also used the Comedy genre as a front to lower my guard to the movie's true nature. Easily pried open my childhood scars from Mars Attacks.

@ritarubin9 I recommend reading the book. Especially if you love gothic horror and romance. It's a hilarious critique of that genre. üòÇ But the movie is very cute too. Stars Felicity Jones. üòç
===
wtf SF9 stealer i didn't expect Jayeoon and Dawon's abs hhh and it feels like I'm watching an action genre movie. Perfect
===
my favourite movie genre is Unhinged Woman.
===
Nomadland: 
Every scene of this movie you can feel Zhao‚Äôs blood, sweat, and tears. She‚Äôs literally defining a new genre of film and it‚Äôs jaw dropping and full of passion. 100% wins best Director and Cinematography; it‚Äôs very likely to win Best Picture and Leading Actress https://t.co/8RSBLv4KGQ

@tom_on_here Honest I was gonna skip cuz it just looked like HunterxHunter type stuff to me, but then I heard that it's the #1 movie in japan, all time, any genre. 

Gotta see what's up with that.
===
@killerwolffilms i just had never seen a movie switch from one genre to the other like that

threw my mind at the time
===
The movie is called

Apoopcalypse: Journey into to the Sewers of Doom.

What genre and plot do you give it?

Go!
===
You know what movie still hasn't gotten enough credit? Troll Hunter. It somehow manages to take an idea that you'd think would be absurd, and it turns that basic idea into a movie that's gripping, scary, funny, and at times, moving. It also revitalizes the fake documentary genre.
===
@ilovejohnkimble The movie created a genre.
===
also this is my favorite movie genre. movies where aging 70s directors wrestle with their faith and obsess about catholicism (e.g. silence and first reformed)
===
I highly recommend it. He gives Sam Rockwell style dance. It has all the elements of a fantastic movie of this genre. If he doesn't win an award for this movie I will be astonished.
===
Dumb as rocks and violent AF is my favorite movie genre
===
@sweetiegoemon ...but it didn't ALSO feel the need to BE a '70s Italian horror movie, like by dressing itself in the trappings of a rape revenge film but cutting out the violence it actually makes its critique that the violent catharsis of the genre is an inherently male appeal of the fantasy
===
It feels emblematic of how a certain vocal subset of audiences approaches deconstruction and cinema overall these days? Like this isn't like say Knives Out, a deconstruction of parlor mystery to explore why we like them, it's a DECONSTRUCTION in that it wants to shame the genre
===
so I've brought it up enough times doing a solo thread on it, Berberian Sound Studio (2012) by Peter Strickland (In Fabric) is to my mind one of if not the BEST example of how to critique and deconstruct an era/genre in cinema https://t.co/JOkvQdD7uR
===
like I said it feels like the movie exists to try and argue rape revenge movies are bad and shouldn't exist, it's an argument against the genre it's in, all of which just feels like a lot of effort for a really empty goal
===
If you watched Courage the Cowardly Dog, Goosebumps, Beetlejuice, Scooby Doo, etc. as a kid, your favorite movie genre is probably horror üëª

I was really looking forward to this movie even though I expected it not to be great. Was really excited to see it be a superhero movie that delves more into the horror genre also they had Magik. I wish is stuck more to the horror thriller vibe it had going with the first trailer https://t.co/XtreCLzJS5

@lvstfulskies @buckysrose Snowblower is very violent, gory and intense. You have to like that kind of genre to like it. I did bc it was very imaginative &amp; clever in story but it was kind of hard to understand &amp; I had to close my eyes in some parts. It's good film-making but not my favorite movie of his
===
@mistydawnfilm Yes! We did a last dragon episode with @danielleradford but that just means you‚Äôd pick a horror and we‚Äôd match it with a martial arts movie you haven‚Äôt seen before! We love folks new to either genre because they go together so well.

@Fadingarcader I absolutely love this movie! It‚Äôs frivolous fun, plain and simple. Folks that sling vitriol at this film seem to take the genre way too seriously.

for me it‚Äôs easily thriller/murder mystery ü§ß
===
I want to see @ScottEastwood and Wyatt Russell in a movie together. If it's not too cliche I think it would be awesome if they were in a Western or buddy cop film. Since they're both in superhero franchises, maybe some independent comic book adaptation or a genre satire.
===
@Treyvon56317559 @EARTH_96283 Is it, though? A lot of people still think it's quite good, and still acknowledge it as one of, if not the, film that kicked off the superhero movie genre

@Leehambones Superhero movie fans are just so annoying and entitled! Your film genre is already the most popular thing in the world right now, what more do you want?

@biomechanicaI netflix's fault because they promoted the movie as a fun genre film with cool lesbians in it like idk Bound or Debs (which are a lot of fun) rather than a pretty dark movie because they wanted a bigger audience for it. just giving a warning because that's still not being said
===
@biomechanicaI A lot of my friends really liked it and felt deeply affected by it but from what I have heard huge trigger warnings for it. It's not a fun/cathartic genre movie like netflix promoted it as. It seems to be a deeply miserable vague and slow movie that's also really good.

that's honestly top 2 movie genre man and it ain't number 2 https://t.co/QGcYyCmTwM

@eviltoads i think the horror movie genre is super varied but like. i just will never get the point of super gorey horror movies like genuinely what is the reason.

Example:

Hitchcock qualifies because, while he may have been mostly a genre director, he did things within that genre that molded the subsequent history of film.
===
You‚Äôve written a screenplay. Without disclosing its plot, what‚Äôs its genre, cast, and noms? #Oscars¬†Ôøº¬†¬†¬† 

Mine is a family drama based on my debut novel. It would earn three noms: Actress (Woodard), Supporting Actress (Nyong‚Äôo), and Adapted Screenplay (@marcusthetoken). https://t.co/2v4YQvheVs
===
@CJNwonka @jasebyjason Really great commentary on this ‚Äòracial horror‚Äô genre which sounds weird in itself. I felt that ‚ÄòSorry to bother you‚Äô (more of a thriller) managed to do something similar to ‚ÄòGet Out‚Äô while also bringing in class/capitalism. Director Boots Riley workshopped it with Peele.
===
@Eon_Reel @JackValentino10 @certainvids Do you even know what a movie genre means? You are aware you can have a cbm that's horror right? Action? Romance? You are aware cbm and drama aren't the same categories? Seriously man maybe google your definitions first before using them poorly.
===
@Eon_Reel @JackValentino10 @certainvids Yes because you're making a movie about a comic book character. If you take it in different directions but it's still about this character and their decent into madness, all that's changed is your story is a character study, that doesn't mean it's a different genre now.
===
@whineror @ItsSaylorMoon @TattoosandToys @getFANDOM @Variety That's literally every single movie genre and alot of movies been have gaps between their last movie so who cares. Alot of stuff isn't up to the fans
===
b &amp; w are actor in Bl genre that not fall into shiping things that require them to attached to their series partner. I love their relation ship as a friend and  partner.. how they respect and kind to each other.. truth to eo.. they are actor. 
Respect them.
===
Guaranteen that a movie of this genre would never win best movie....and yes best movie will always be the top prize https://t.co/TxggMcpBk3
===
@Eon_Reel @RemyDushine @certainvids You act like a comic book movie is one specific thing that isn‚Äôt allowed to do anything else. This film is making the term ‚Äúcomic book movie‚Äù more broad and open and it is transcending the genre.
===
@mrpauldunphy Spectre is my least favorite EON Bond film. However.....even a bad Bond film is still better than 90% of regular cinema releases in any genre.

===
@titMcGrit2 Maybe. But it‚Äôs engrossing and well-acted/made. A good example of a genre thriller where - much like a cool action movie - it‚Äôs the journey, not the destination. If everything else works, it doesn‚Äôt matter if the outcome or overal execution isn‚Äôt highly unique.

@dianamhs70 @FiercePenelope Thanks! What types of movies do you like? I‚Äôm a huge comedy fan but like just about any genre except horror. Old Boy (or maybe it‚Äôs Ol Boy) is a Korean classic. It‚Äôs a very intense movie about vengeance after a man is locked in a room for 20+ years.
