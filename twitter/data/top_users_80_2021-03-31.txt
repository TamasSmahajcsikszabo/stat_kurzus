@Junazaru @FloodgateGames @VincentDutrait You designed an amazing game 🤩
===
@kjrevia @whatseplaying @dannibelow I'm just imagining how this played out in my head and I can't stop laughing

@whatseplaying @dannibelow @kjrevia amazing 🤣🤣

@fertessa @beth_sobel @WeirdGiraffes Lmaooo I feel like I’m at a ✨slight✨ disadvantage
===
@ElenaCSanchez Of course! I’ve been really enjoying it 😊
===

Join us here: https://t.co/Z2mJKVrzFX at 8pm EST https://t.co/dilJdoiPWu
===
@Jellyfish_GS @kovraystudios @425suzanne It's not the cost, it's my pile upon piles of unplayed games in Steam 😅😅
===
@CharityBrdGamer @Boardgame_girl1 @BoardgameDog @BoardgameHound Yaasss - I hope you got alllll the fries hahaha
===
@kjrevia @benosteen @kovraystudios @Maho42 what I'm hearing is that we all need to play a game. It seems like @Maho42 and I play the same way lmaoo
===
@benosteen @kjrevia @kovraystudios Omg yes 100%. It’s the best feeling cause you know they won’t take it. So you see how far you can push your friends lmao
===
We can’t celebrate #Holi this year but we can play the boardgame! The beautiful colors, the flavor text and this 3D board, just wow 🤩🥳 My family actually asked to play this again, which is a win in this household! ⁣
⁣
Have y’all played it? What did you think? #boardgames https://t.co/eaW6MNMH47
===
@dannibelow Just to put up! The 90s are apparently back haha
===
@1minboardgames I have a shopping cart of skincare that has been hanging out for a few days. Everyday my will power decreases...
===
@annamaria_jp You got this 🙌🏼
===
@victoriacana Love 🤩
===
My parents got their second dose today and I’m just so happy!! It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I had been so worried for them 😭😭
===
@Jellyfish_GS @kovraystudios @425suzanne Y'all are convincing me to buy this game and I really don't need more games 😭😭
===
@EminteaWASD This is such a lovely picture 💖
===
@kjrevia @benosteen @kovraystudios Lmao I’ve accidentally done this before
===
GET HYPEEE!! The next Mukbang &amp; Games is this Friday with the amazing @Panda8ngel @BraininaJar2 @PaulaDeming! We'll be playing Blank Slate by @TheOpGames and as always, chat is invited to play along! I'll also be doing a GIVEAWAY, so join us here: https://t.co/pAWRiRiTOL https://t.co/w9yOvU2usZ

Live now with @annamaria_jp! Come hang out and rate the BGG Top 100 with us! https://t.co/Z2mJKVrzFX https://t.co/NNBwElAFIc
===
Dream Runners by @AnkamaBG is so vibrant 🤩 You're racing to complete a grid using tiles you've bought while simultaneously trying to fight off nightmares and collect loot! I absolutely love tile placement games and this one is a winner! If you've played it, what did you think? https://t.co/nGhczELw7J
===
@BramBeardGaming @BoardgameSpam LMAO THE POWER THE CLAWDRATE HOLDS!
===
@benosteen @1minboardgames I have so much skin care. Like SO MUCH 😭😅
===
@Gamefreakgeek whoa looks great!
===

@whatseplaying @Nerdsbeware Hello Eric,

Thank you for your tweet. It's always nice to hear that people agree with you.

Hope you're doing well.

Best,

Live now with @fertessa and @annamaria_jp https://t.co/Z2mJKVrzFX https://t.co/0LcJPvoxfe
===
@beforeyouplay_ @FloodgateGames @VincentDutrait @Junazaru Omg that would be amazing! One day!!
===
@geekygaymerguy @AnkamaBG @ImportsLuma Right?! Have you played it yet??
===
@BoardgameSpam @TabletopLiveNet I will never forgive Andrew for this hahaha
===
@hornist_34 Glad you had fun!!
===
Happy #Holi2021 for all my friends who celebrate it 💖💖
===
@estefaniar88 @dannibelow I need to do this as well! @beneeta_k sent me some amazing bath bombs - need to treat myself.
===
@brogadishu @SeanRMoorhead the goal of npr is to broadcast the sound of someone crying. they want to do this as often as possible
===
@McmurtyPatrick @ShawnaBnana @BenjaminNorton @RMpodol what
===
@GuyTheReply what is it
===
@IreneUnfiltered @BenjaminNorton if israel did that it would kick ass tbh
===
@CSMFHT @RealBearHours art history phd with an emphasis in italian futurism
===
@jowrotethis the nostalgia critic fell off
===
@fairleft @ToddSmekens @BenjaminNorton i’ll agree when dive bars get urine pads of xi’s face like they had for bin laden
===
@booby_brown @Delta8CBD @OmariJHardy lets tax cardboard boxes that say amazon on the side
===
@RadishHarmers to me, santa and the inevitable discovery hes not real has always felt like an absurdly obvious metaphor for god also not being real. like something a flying spaghetti monster atheist would use to instruct their kid. depictions of god even look like santa?
===
@vrunt how about “mayor meat” and he looks like mayor mccheese but no cheese
===
@xjeremymx @arb okay theres a difference between ai bots and people who are paid to pretend to act like happy employees
===
@RadishHarmers its got to do with her fanbase. same reason that conspiracy theorist guys like alex jones have fans who think in conspiracy theories, and then start to include alex jones in their theories.
===
@xjeremymx @arb what
===
@forgaoqiang @Michael_Hieber @BenjaminNorton eh, over the last decade secondary sactions effectively give the us the ability to totally remove a country from the market. im no expert but this looks kind of like its a package deal for a bunch of oil over time instead of selling barrels in the normal market?
===
@rxfracctory am i going to have to start reading Q drops just to understand how republicans talk now?

&gt; The US has vowed to bring down Chinese Government. 

i never got past this, when did this happen? did i miss something lol
===
@allahliker @ByYourLogic you’ll love their upcoming spinoff Bright Souls
===
@Gator34109853 @jowrotethis yea idk why the rules are different for books. if someone likes the transformers movies or Drake or something who cares
===
@edavidds @nandelabra @kj1313 its very clearly bait, which i’m now guessing is a defense mechanism, so that you can tell yourself you were “just trolling”

hope people dont fall for it but this is twitter
===
@nohomejerome_ @RickyRawls my friend honestly told me the last bad episode is the stuck in the lab with a fly episode, after that its worth watching. tried to start earlier multiple times and gave up, but hes right
===
@LandoJH @OurHiddenHistry @nandelabra so, this story is unusually one-sided.

morales literally quadrupled bolivias gdp as president. the nyt apologized for covering the election as suspicious in a whole second article. the interim government delayed the election three times... then his party won even harder
===
@RickyRawls apparently his first job was running a companys twitter
===
@str8churlish @uncledoomer reverse political alignment chart
===
@xjeremymx @arb ya sorry i have just been following this stuff. gpt2 algorithms are literally being hidden by openai because they worry they could drown out all meaningful comments on social media with bots saying random shit. if you look at their subreddits its insane how advanced they are
===
@edavidds @nandelabra @kj1313 “its racist to even consider u.s. interference in a latin american election“ is pretty obvious bait, i guess you never seriously believed this
===
@anastasiakeeley nice rug!
===
@PeacefulMoron honestly its a great argument for markets solving problems in innovative ways
===
@nandelabra hey i know this guy lol
===
@kj1313 @nandelabra @edavidds i mean its right there at the top of the wikipedia page. 

until 1990 the oas was supposed to fight communism, after 1990 it switched to election monitoring — completely unrelated unless the whole point is stopping socialism https://t.co/ny2ciF8VLu
===
@DadderGonzo @Chad_of_CHAZ @MattBruenig theyre getting into a tiny house
===
@StinkyBenjamin @beanytuesday this is also true
===
@ApeGoblin @BenjaminNorton sanctions alone killed over 250,000 children — just children — in iraq between the gulf and iraq war. 

it is a weapon yet somehow ”doesn’t count” as a declaration of war. this gives me hope that the us will no longer be able to destroy countries without even being questioned
===
@afshinrattansi i love Children of Men, classic movie. great reference guys
===
@extranapkins my tombstone
===
@xjeremymx @arb their comments also all kinda sound like “well its pretty safe. they say safety is their top priority. but i did twist my ankle, but they gave me PTO” kind of comments where theyre like arguing with themselves, and some of the amazon twitters look like that
===
@burger_enjoyer @OurHiddenHistry @Chinchillazllla guys youre not gonna believe what i found in my fried rice
===
@carolinefiend she was writing thr book
===
@beneeta_k My motto is if I put it in my cart, come back a week later and still want it...... I’m buying it 😂
===
@beneeta_k I know my friend retail therapy all too well... 😅
===

The worst part of all this is that it was so predictable. 

We have over 10k retired nurses and medics, over 1500 pharmacies.

Yet you can bet your house we'll have @paulreiddublin on Claire Byrne in mid-July telling us they've commissioned an independent review into the balls up https://t.co/mBGDer0ska
===
@Diakyuto claire balls
===
@beneeta_k @kovraystudios @425suzanne Its only like $9 or something if that helps😬

Its just very relaxing
===
@beneeta_k @kovraystudios @425suzanne I mean, that’s also fair😅
===
@litolnymph yeah !!! i think i’m just a bit burnt out atm 😓
===
@litolnymph SAME i’m trying to get back into it but it is just. not working 😓😓 hopefully i’ll get inspo soon or something
===
// death | murder

just realized i have all the freedom to come up with a reason why bluebeard killed his first wife... HOHO
===
hii fankids will try to reply to some stuff todya and maybe wake the server again.. good luck to meeeee
===
@fearIeadings samee &lt;33 but it always returns to activity in the end :&gt;
===
really miss when fankid twt and the server were busy &lt;33 but it seems like we all got a little uninterested, but at least it's at the same time!! hope we get on the hype again soonnnn
===
the best thing to come out of dolltwt in my experience was the fankids and a few more friends
===
CLOSES ALL MY TABS ....................... I FINISHED
===
soo now we have to reply to 

- headmaster office
- beanstalk bakery

is this all??
===
if u guys wanna share new cool things you're coming up with ur characters... pspsps 💞 perhaps if we talk abt them the spirit comes back
===
i showed the google doc about pacts to mimi. now we wait
===
i can't believe i wrote that whole pact thing in like 4 hours and now i can't even write a simple rp reply
===
@azurasgf I'LL GIVE IT ANOTHER LOOK AND THEN... YOU'LL BE THE FIRST ONE TO SEE CUZ I WANT UR OPINION
===
@ghostgrrI yeahh me too 😕 every time i try to write i feel like I'm not doing as well as i was before or just... simply can't write &lt;//3 but it comforts me that the server always comes back to activity and we actually played almost everyday for like a straight month
===
@ghostgrrI I DARE YOU https://t.co/4iBNz4lUel
===
really wish i could write today but my brain said no &lt;3 you're gonna lay there without knowing how to formulate a single sentence
===
I'm a little :// abt it too tbh, not doing too well with writing skensks but it's okay i feel like there's no one really waiting for my replies
===
okay no i also need to reply to coffin corridors so we can finish there me thinks
===
@beneeta_k @AnkamaBG Dream Runners - Board Game Review https://t.co/SNoVruD1JF
===
@beneeta_k @AnkamaBG @ImportsLuma I just uploaded my review of this one today. I haves fun playing this one. My one question is the replayability. But the family enjoyed that race to grab that sand timer before everyone else.
===
@beneeta_k For ponies, or just to put it up?
===
@beneeta_k It cost..too much..for a scrunchie, but I also love it so I dont care
===
Luke's 3 balls are a funny colour. He's holding the green one Claire is holding his blue one and the yellow is surplus to requirements #cblive https://t.co/z3miYgVjVW
===
@beneeta_k Ok, I maaaaaay have to order one then.
===
@Sim_DonLothario @sim_dreamer @ServoSims @TheLoreMayCome Don, Claire chopped your balls of after you’ve impregnated her.... So yeah, your kid.
===
@beneeta_k @AnkamaBG @ImportsLuma I liked that I didn’t have to feel like I was “the fastest” to feel like I was doing. Well!
===
@kovraystudios @beneeta_k It is 100% the best game for realizing your friends and family are actual monsters.
===
@beneeta_k @benosteen @kovraystudios @Maho42 Yes, please!
===
@benosteen @beneeta_k @kovraystudios If you're my SO you send it around so many times that I run out of coins and have to take it 😭
===
@beneeta_k @benosteen @kovraystudios It's @Maho42 's favorite game and he's also evil. 😘
===
@beneeta_k @whatseplaying @dannibelow And it legit surprised the hell out of me. 

Ended in some good cry laughing though. 

Post vaxx BuddyCon chaos we can play this new one.
===
@beneeta_k @1minboardgames I was literally thinking the same exact thing. Man I feel like going dancing now 💃🏻
===
@beneeta_k @AnkamaBG @ImportsLuma This looks lovely, definitely wanna try
===
@beneeta_k @AnkamaBG @ImportsLuma No I haven’t! I sure would like to at some point😍
===
@beneeta_k @AnkamaBG @ImportsLuma Whoa! That’s pretty🤩
===
Another week and more fun games with lovely people!😍
Is there a game you want to see me play solo or w/ John? Please reply below!

@beneeta_k @Nerdsbeware Hello!

Thank you for your tweet; I agree with this sentiment wholeheartedly.

Best,

What's Eric Playing?
===
@beneeta_k Hello Beneeta!

You too!

Best,

What's Eric Playing?
===
@beneeta_k Hi Beneeta!

Thanks for your reply. I am also doing well.

Hope the same for you!

What's Eric Playing?
===
@kjrevia @beneeta_k @benosteen @kovraystudios @Maho42 I would totally buy a Flanders themed version though...
===
@Rev_Claire "I'm sorry, do you have kidney stones?"

I have balls, and I'd rather not. Please just schedule my appointment.
===
@kjrevia @beneeta_k @benosteen @kovraystudios Always down to play no thanks
===
@beneeta_k @kjrevia I’m an absolute monster. However, this game is such a blast I can’t believe we haven’t played it before you introduce it to us, super grateful for you for the introduction. I would apologize for my actions but it wouldn’t be an honest apology 😜
===
@BramBeardGaming @DannyPlaysGamez @beneeta_k Thank you, happy to hear :)
===
@edavidds @MitchellAHorton @nandelabra @nick_mcco Everyone I don’t like is a tankie 😒
===
@nick_mcco All different things
===
@nick_mcco @RadishHarmers when I was a kid I went to a sermon about exactly this lol. the pastor was talking about how santa shouldn't be apart of christmas because it might give kids ideas when they realize he's not real
===
@Pyro_VR @RukiRookie @Gilbryn1 I both want to go "Oh god what happened" and "Yes, knee him in the balls Claire, do it."
===
When your new arch-nemesis @beneeta_k (See what you have done @BoardgameSpam) raids your stream, there's only one thing to do... Clawdrate... https://t.co/ePOEJXXph9
===
@beneeta_k @BoardgameSpam It’s cross dimensional. Thanks for the raid!
===
Loving the play-through of Inspector Waffles so far. Chat has been making even more fun with word bans/swaps which have kind of been made canon in our play. Thanks for the raids @DannyPlaysGamez and @beneeta_k last night, great seeing you all and your communities! https://t.co/tPwzUq8ED4
===
@beneeta_k @FloodgateGames @VincentDutrait @Junazaru Happy Holi @beneeta_k !
===
@edavidds @nick_mcco @kj1313 @nandelabra The first clue for everyone to realize you don't know what you're talking about is that you adorably cite Wikipedia to back up your claims 😆
===
@nick_mcco @kj1313 @nandelabra @edavidds The OAS is used as a form of soft power to exert influence in Latin American countries for geostrategic purposes. That is a fact
===
@Rajeevdev1 @akvinchrist @GeneralBakshi Yar hm Shia aur Sunni ka talwa chatein  tb bhi no problem.
China is talwa to na chato kam az kam.
===
Claire just came up to me on the couch and said “daddy you’re best dad in the whole world” and went to give me the biggest hug, as she stepped towards me her foot fell off the couch and she kneed me in the balls.
===
@akvinchrist @Markhorpakarmyi @GeneralBakshi I m a proud bhakt. You say you are a proud Chamcha😁. Say it....
===
@akvinchrist @Markhorpakarmyi @GeneralBakshi Pagal....read the msg properly before commenting😁
U r a perfect congress supporter. U deserve to be only in Congress. Stay blessed 👍😉
===
Love it when your 1 year memories pop up &amp; make you lol, no make shift today he can wack balls till his hearts content from today  !! 🤣🏌️‍♂️⛳️ https://t.co/2Dhb5jZuRg
===
@nandelabra @nick_mcco @kj1313 Wtf are you talking about? I am defeating these lies &amp; delusions and explaining how the world really works. I’m doing a public service. 

Pearls before swine, I guess.
===
@nick_mcco @nandelabra @kj1313 It’s not bait. It’s rational. I am not hearing reasonable analysis of US involvement, I’m hearing “omg US did a right wing coup!!!1 OAS is a CIA project!”
===
@nick_mcco @kj1313 @nandelabra “hoped”.... It was not a stated  purpose. It was just something everyone was worried about back then.

There were 8 stated purposes. I’ve highlighted two of them: https://t.co/Ywfsf96jIL
===
@nick_mcco @nandelabra @kj1313 wat? I am the one sharing the detailed understanding of how the world works. He is the one saying “tweet through it” (?)
===
@goat_classic @nandelabra @nick_mcco @kj1313 True, I have been to many non-rich countries, but not Bolivia yet.

But I can say this: every f*ing time I see an actual Bolivian or Venezuelan online, they are on my side. At very least they have a much more sophisticated opinion than “white overlords secretly run my country.” https://t.co/CUECueicWm
===
@MitchellAHorton @nandelabra @nick_mcco @kj1313 I disagree.. I’m simply trying to argue vigorously w dozens of people
===
@MitchellAHorton @nandelabra @nick_mcco @kj1313 Yes, of course. It’s efficient. It’s me vs dozens of uninformed tankies.
===
@keenwaa @nick_mcco @kj1313 @nandelabra No asshole, read the wikipedia page about it. It’s just a group of western-hemisphere democracies supporting each other. https://t.co/Bae8K6ryKO
===
@edavidds @nandelabra @nick_mcco @kj1313 You've never been to Bolivia
===
@edavidds @keenwaa @nick_mcco @kj1313 @nandelabra Do you know what "influence" is
===
@edavidds @goat_classic @nandelabra @nick_mcco @kj1313 How do you know they are from those countries again?
===
@edavidds @nandelabra @nick_mcco @kj1313 You realize you're admitting to a TOS violation right
===
@edavidds @nandelabra @nick_mcco @kj1313 More spam replies?
===
Chat was hilarious last night. They were killing us 🤣 while we were killing them 💀. "Everyone wants me to live" -@beneeta_k's famous last words. Thanks to anyone who jumped on while we streamed during @TabletopLiveNet. The Monkey King thanks you 🐵. https://t.co/0UqcTbVBAK
===
@edavidds @nick_mcco @kj1313 The American empire appreciates your service.
===
@edavidds @nick_mcco @kj1313 Tweet through it hoss
===
@beneeta_k My parents are both done now too! Progress!
===
@beneeta_k No lie it tasted amazing. 😍🤤
===
@BoardgameSpam @beneeta_k @TabletopLiveNet That stream was hilarious. I'll have to see rest with the VOD to see if I was ultimately avenged.
===
@beneeta_k @FloodgateGames @VincentDutrait Glad you all enjoyed it! It will never replace the real festival, but I hope that it brings a smile to everyone that plays it! Happy Holi!
===
I didn’t even know there was a board game!! Omg I love the tabletop world so much 🌏💖 Thanks for sharing this @beneeta_k https://t.co/Q2ZlgBxR99
===
@beneeta_k I’ve never seen a game that looks like this before. Fitting for such a bright, joyous holiday!! 🌈
===
@beneeta_k @beforeyouplay_ @FloodgateGames @VincentDutrait @Junazaru Wait, you throw colors? Why don't we all do this? That sounds like fun!
===
@beneeta_k @FloodgateGames @VincentDutrait @Junazaru Happy Holi Beneeta!!! Wish we could throw colors with you one day!
===
@BoardgameSpam @beneeta_k @TabletopLiveNet It was fun to watch and be in the chat. Naming your sea creatures after your chatters was an interesting touch. 🙂 It made for fun interactions in the chat.
===
@nick_mcco my interpretation 

cold war 
or
turtle pulling its head into its shell for safety/ retreat /surrender / flying white flag

no signs of U.S. utilizing the 2nd option.
===
@nick_mcco i'm the last person to inquire about translating Republiklan-speak. sorry.

best i can do is 
"words words racism words bigot-shitt racism, stealing jorbs, words, ehmurgrants superpower patriot, marika, words, racism"
===
@nick_mcco @arb yes this is true and I misspoke or misremembered BUT it’s still gross and lame
===
@w_network @SamHeughan If he wasn’t a fictional character or if I was one ? Well it’s tough because sometimes I think I could love him to death and others I just want to cut his balls off ... so depending on the context something hugely romantico-kinky or something like he told Claire “you left me “
===
@beneeta_k @fertessa @beth_sobel @WeirdGiraffes Don't count on it.   I'm 0-for-about 3 years on one of my designs
===
@beneeta_k @beth_sobel @WeirdGiraffes Now here's a game I can beat you at😂
===
@Boardgame_girl1 @BoardgameDog @BoardgameHound I found my Zen yesterday with a meal from Five Guys. Had been craving it for sometime since @beneeta_k's Foodie channel in the Discord.
===
@beneeta_k @Boardgame_girl1 @BoardgameDog @BoardgameHound So. Many. Fries...
===
I actually remember freaking out at that long ribbon streamer stuff hanging down. I thought the fire balls are going to come up soon. What if it sets alight 😂. Think I was more stressed than them on that tour. Think it's 1 of the reasons why It's not one of my fave tours 🙈
===
Good job to @beneeta_k for winning the first game! :D! Now I’m off to planning dinner since their whole conversation made me hungry lol https://t.co/36UNIHbIrD https://t.co/0fy1iijNhw
===
@beneeta_k Of course! It’s nice to hear you all chatting.
===
Thank you, @beneeta_k for a great stream tonight! #TLNHYPE
===
UP NEXT: LIVE at 4pm PT / 7pm ET @beneeta_k  #boardgames #tabletopgames #TwitchStreamers #TabletopLiveNetwork #TLN #TLNV Watch here ---&gt; https://t.co/UuN7G1M31M https://t.co/llKVDzr4ik
===
Love this island but ffs its poxy sh1t trying to find atleast 1 good Dr and dentist.. I seem to know more info than the dam dentist did. Its one cock up after the other.. Every procedure I've had done medically has been a balls up.
===
@nick_mcco @Chad_of_CHAZ @MattBruenig I didn't want to like this but I had to, contractually obligated to like puns as a dad.
===
Do the contestants shout at the balls every week? #thewall
===
@PaulDalyROI That's for the ice cream. The pits were just white chocolate ganache (milkybar + cream), formed into balls and covered in dark chocolate
===
Thanks to @FAA1899 for the @DribbleUp soccer balls.  Joshua and Claire getting their touches in this past week.  500 touches this week. Awesome at home training system that keeps it fun.  Excited to get back on field this weekend though! https://t.co/rB6iEyup1t

@beneeta_k Cappuccinos for breakfast and decaf for the rest of the day.  It's a little bit ritualistic:

weigh beans
grind beans 
espresso
steam milk
fail to create satisfactory foam art
enjoy coffee.

@beneeta_k I love cold brew in the summer, but in the winter I enjoy a nice pour over.
