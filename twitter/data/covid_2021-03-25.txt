All of my work is now available on face masks. The cloth mask designed to cover your nose and mouth when out in public and has a pocket for a filter.  I will make $1 per mask and it will be donated to a local food bank. #facemask #blueflowers https://t.co/eFK6C2NSkD https://t.co/MfLP4LqyeF

How to get businesses to go along with this? Tell them they can have more customers if they check the covid pass.

No social distancing required. Just check the vaccine passport.

No wonder they pushed small businesses to the breaking point.

I won't be having the vaccine because that is my choice, your worried about Covid you have one and then you don't need to worry about me and others.

This is appalling and should not be allowed to happen. Are people aware that they are taking part in a trial? These vaccines offer no immunity or prevent transmission, therefore, if forced to have vaccine does not guarantee that you you won‚Äôt get Covid or pass it on. https://t.co/t5KaoHqk0b
