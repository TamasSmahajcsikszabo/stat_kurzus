@A_LUIGI_ @ZenoKagemaru @Tekwizwa @OWAnonymous_ field is a start tbh if they change it. more fair play should be prevalent in this game. good decision making = getting rewarded. i just think they should do net nerfs across the board to lower power creep and oppressive abilities that nobody likes.

This Jane got mad because this Meg and I left her with a key so she texted me and called me a bum and said I'm bad yet she only had 14k blood points on the score board honey leave me alone. Then this bitch said she'll boot me offline like girl, you can't win every game. https://t.co/7MMkxI1vZ3

@bushontheradio I’m normally well up for a board game, but these strategy ones are tedious. Played Catan once. Never again. Risk can do one too. 

You should try “Where Is Moldova?”

@AJMattis @Medtechcerb Go back to you game board
===
@NanaPharcyde @One_In_Hundred @Fantasaur Actually, it’s pretty interesting you say this, because I remember the Ding Dong livestream mentioning the game, and how he felt it was a cynical exploitation of the lgbt as a marketing ploy. I was not always on board with Oneyplays, but Ding Dong was on point imo.

@Ianiesta8 Grinding those results is a skill that players need especially in Div 1 and 2. 

Can be hard to be motivated to perform when the opposition is not playing the game as it should be played.

Interesting game for the C64 by @alescandy in which you print a board, grab a dice+pawns and then fire up the game to be the opponent&amp;environment.

Last time I played something like this was Mechs vs Minions with @KeeperArcanus and @KerryGuard.

Oh, and it uses my Polaris font :)
===
@klobrille Only nice thing for me are features like chat / game sound control and wireless. Sound-wise, you can get A LOT more for even cheaper. Not to mention way more if you're willing to pay a little extra. Gaming labeled headsets are usually trash across the board.

The Square 100 represented Nirvana or Moksha. The top of each ladder depicted a God or one of the various heavens (kailasa, vaikuntha, brahmaloka) and so on.
As the game progressed various actions were supposed to take you up and down the board as in life…

@CelticGossip @CelticFC It's been proved ,just a puppet show, soup taking board, as long their shares are profitable, they don't have ambition,no Europe, sell Rodgers, he was head and shoulders above,can't have that in the Scottish game,can't afford to do without sevco

I would like to acknowledge the Celtic board on carrying out the plan to the letter, keeping them in the game,punch and Judy show, L30 per tv home game,you don't care,you get paid regardless,Paul Larkin you covered refereeing,Now cover Peter lawwell ? ?
===
@_ekerej Very attainable skill level if you solve tactics regularly.
I spent about 30 seconds before making that move( Which is a lot of time in a blitz game).
A lot of it has to do with trusting your intuition and recognizing familiar patterns on the board.

@p_dan_tic I (Nia) liked it a lot but it's very different to the film. Less overtly horror (but still horror) and took me a while to really get on board but by the end I was completely invested.

The game is great too!

@serinide Same with all the other toxic games. Everyone has a Pro complex. Then when I out do them by playing my way and having fun they get salty.

Back them, give them opportunities, let them grow in their roles, they will provide you the results. Instead, what we have is an apathetic board that waited a full year to give them a game. All they had in between was an apology of an exhibition tournament.

@HoopsWeiss I think @franfraschilla tweeted earlier that he thinks that with things shut down last year, “mid-major” coaches had more time to study the game without time constraints (sorry if I misinterpreted, Fran). It would make a lot of sense based on what’s happening across board.

@SOUL_GIFTED Lol that's not how it works,  once a player is in the air you can't Have any contact, he looks over his shoulder,  sees him running for the board,  steps in his way then pushes his back when he's in the air.  A non- call would be blowing the game, that's a blatant foul.
===
@Vinciano_ Very clearly a foul.. you CANNOT touch a player at all when they're in the air going for a board or shooting, not even a little.  It's a foul,  even Randle admitted it was a foul in his post game but he was mad it wasn't called consistently all game.  Foul,  not debatable

@Melcatzzzz @13walshy @FOXFOOTY Mel, people are DYING because of head injuries in this sport (see: Shane Tuck). If “ruining the physicality” of the game is going to prevent these kinds of traumas, I am all on board. Also, if you think without that bump, the match wasn’t physical, you clearly weren’t watching.

My first time appearing on a stage was at a board game convention.
My first time on a camera (that wasn't my phone) was for a board game stream.

Just because you've never done it before, doesn't mean you can't. Both were kinda scary, but I took the leap and loved the experience.

@AndrewContrucci You can’t slap the back board and hang on the rim. Dumb rule but it was an obvious call. Tech got whacked 2 straight possessions at the end and no call! Just an absolute robbery and I didn’t even have money on the game <U+0001F602>

@tea_tabletop Yup, it’s in the instructions. Normal game scoring is - three colors in a group for a color button, matching the patterns of quilt to cat preference (usually a group or a row) for a cat token, and 3 tiles on the board for matching 6 hexes around the tile’s scoring requirements..
===
@tea_tabletop This last scoring method, the three tiles on the board...IS SO IMPOSSIBLE AND MAKES THE GAME BONKERS STRESSFUL!!!  So in the family game, the three tile’s scoring requirements are ignored, and you just play with colors and patterns.... which is calm and relaxing.

@Polygon I'm just finding it so ironic that the moment I decide to finally play the computer game and get hooked on it, that not only is a major expansion coming out for it, but that there's this really cool board coming out for it. I'm excited for it and already backed it. :)

I don’t think that you can just make your game and multiply a “normal” price by 4 and sell it and expect to have a sustainable business; it’s more complicated than that.

But it’s very obvious that across the board, expectations are detached from reality.

@AwsomeSauce_em Yeah if the idea is “we lost the game because of the refs, but Brees played terrible” then I’m on board. But there were enough other errors from other players that it goes back to “everyone has some level of blame” in it being such a close game that the refs ultimately called it.

I firmly believe in a late game situation you need to shoot with about 6 seconds left to give yourself a shot at an offensive board. I hate when teams wait too long. (Looking at you, SFA!)

Another nice game for Oladipo. He needs to be the name at the top of the Clippers board.

@GailSimone Adventure land is amazing... and Kramer and Kiesling are like the peanut butter and chocolate of board game designers. :)

@iam_kennybreezy Your board doesn’t care, so long as you will forgive him after he wins the next game

The USC Trojans have a $70M facility including a two-story video board for recruits *to watch TV and study game film.*. The Oregon Ducks have a barber shop, sauna and 170-seat movie theater.

WHAT. THE. ACTUAL. FUCK.

@Denner7s I think it could be a good game for Moyes to put his point over to the board, the good and bad side of our current set-up. The subs bench was appalling for this level, there's no changes he could have made that would have won us the game imo.

@bestcanton7 @privilege_mufc But we have improved, if u gonna allow one game to define our progress maybe u have always had ur agenda and not been on board. Each loss has its dynamics and merits. And its unique.

TIL the 2012 online diplomacy World Cup final didn’t end until 2016. The website broke and had to be updated to allocate more memory to store the game’s press. Every single supply center on the board changed hands at least once. It ended in a four way tie in Spring 2005.

I am now unashamedly ADDICTED to #MouseTrapMondays #ShawnWoods. As a kid I ALWAYS wanted the Mousetrap board game, and growing up a MacGyver fan... well... yeah. Have now binged about 2hrs of this man, and he is truly the Bob Ross of Mousetraps <U+0001F929><U+0001F42D>

My board game PRO list:

Rearrangeable map of some kind.
Cool looking game pieces or figures.
Organic winning conditions.
GREAT ARTWORK.
Weird or surprising theme.
Playable solo. (Thanks, Covid.)
Box that organizes game that came in it.
===
My board game CON list:

1) Generic meeples instead of real game pieces.
2) Cheap cardboard tokens. Especially if I have to punch them out.
3) Victory points.

Not absolute deal breakers, but definitely all things that suggest I should go look at more games.

We played The Godfather board game yesterday. I was surprisingly entertained.

The chess board is the world, the pieces are the phenomena of the universe, the rules of the game are what we call the Laws of Natures. The player on the other side is hidden from us. Thomas Henry Huxley
===
@SaffronOlive @DrSamWaters1 Ultimately no.
If both have a solid board state: I agree that they (or I) could simply be thinking how to turn the game around, how to block efficiently, etc.
But if we’re both playing rather quickly until I clearly will get the win &amp; you burn 4 ropes: I’ll gladly wait ftw <U+0001F60E>

@lichfielddean As a board game player of some 60 years and I’ve played all the classics from Chess to Guess Who my opinion on the matter is clearly superior as I have spelled out my qualifications before making a snide remark about your previous comment.
===
Got to admit. Moura was probably my worst spurs player, just couldn’t get on board with him. But what a turnaround this is starting to be. Quality. Hopefully adds G/A to his pressing game .
===
@Vintage_Utd Fred is never as good a player as that described when people overly praise him after a great game nor as bad as he is slated after a game eg today. He had a shocker &amp; big part of why we lost but he is worthy of squad place. If board gets Ole Ndidi or Rice then it would help!

@kgb_files @jesse_history My little brother was a light /heavy weapons specialist in the late 70's early 80's in the Airborne. He obtained a copy of this that came my way. I used this to set up units of Soviet Infantry miniatures to board game with. Loads of fun.

@PyrexGen ole got it wrong today, mctom was perfect as his so press resistance, still tho fred is so shit and this game cries out to the board that we need a DM, All 3 goals of theirs were preventable, winning the Europa league for ole is a MUST imo
===
Magelof and McFred cost us the game yet again. Matic is done at this level. Fans will cry out for the right players but board won't give 2 shits.

Man City will win the quadruple this season. 

What has happened to this great club?

@Doyler1976 Your 100% we miles off it still.. 65 min in before he makes changes baffled me also ..can’t just hope that luck carry’s you thru the game like ole seems to be doing at times ..I can’t see the board moving him on either

@notaterrornerd In 50 years its likely nobody will know what the battle of Mosul was, if weird nerds treating it like a board game are still thinking about it its better than it being forgotten. At least in my opinion.

@MUFCReloaded Yea you’re right This comes back to the board. But we could have won that game with the players we put out with a better manager and better tactics. I love Ole but he is simply not the man.

Keys to the game
Nuggets vs Pelicans

<U+0001F511> Protect the paint - Zion scores nearly 20 ppg in the paint ALONE

<U+0001F511> Battle of the board - Pelicans are best offensive rebounding team in NBA, win rebounds https://t.co/aTuq8fd5eb

@UnitedStandMUFC I been disappointed for so long there is no even pain no more just numbness. I don't put this on Ole let's put the blame on the board because if we had a proper CB we wouldn't have lost this game. Also a proper midfield pivot
===
Feeling pretty accomplished today. Did meal prep for both lunch and breakfast for the week (started a new diet), did some laundry, cleaned all the dishes (multiple times) and am about to go out for a walk. maybe play a board game afterward.
