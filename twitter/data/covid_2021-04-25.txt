@littlebirdwoman @thelucyjohnston @VanessaBails @rwjdingwall @CebmOxford Did you go around blaming everyone who doesn't wear a mask or doesn't take the flu vaccine? Or did you just accept that you were unfortunate to get sick and focus on getting better?
Would you expect us to lockdown every flu season, just because you got sick once?
Selfish much?!

Hold on... the fact that the vaccinated are currently as likely to feel anxious as the non-vaccinated "suggests that the vaccine is not an anxiety reducer"?

Wouldn't those who are more anxious to begin with be more likely to get vaccinated?
