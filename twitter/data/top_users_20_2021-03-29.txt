@markwalters74 @pattonoswalt I can[t blood feud with @pattonoswalt, he is nice and also has MODOK powers.
===
What if I switched my blood feud to @blumjordan? 

He seems like a good guy and thus I will have the advantage of surprise.
===
@harald387 I'm nice.

I‚Äôm lost without a blood feud. https://t.co/yWwdKkNHvQ
===
@1godzillafan I know how it ends.
===
In Japan, it is pronounced 'Gorija.''
===
Also, announcement: I am ENDING my blood feud with John Cena because he made me laugh in the Suicide Squad trailer.

I need a new blood feud.
===
Do you know any celebrities who I could have a blood feud with please https://t.co/I24reMfDUG
===
@PossibleCabbage I can‚Äôt have a blood feud with @PFTompkins, he is my favorite.

===
@GailSimone You really are evil incarnate.
===
@GailSimone You are! But also evil.
===
@GailSimone I thought it was pronounced "Gailja."
===
@GailSimone Wait are you talking about the state or the country?
===
@GailSimone Is Gorija's breath hot, or just concussive force?
===
@GailSimone This has always been my theory re: Tom and Chet: https://t.co/qrWSGGLrXz
===
@GailSimone That's a strange way to pronounce "King Kong."
===
@GailSimone There's what's-his-name, playing Black Adam. You can take him.

@JohnLawMedia @GailSimone When the Japanese gave us a perfectly cromulent word for them.
===
@GailSimone Have you considered @RJCity1? He's another wrestler so feuds are his thing, he's a heel, he used to be on a show where his job was to taunt children and make them fall into the water, he knows @DanhausenAD and maybe @DavidArquette,  and he'll look at you over his shoulder.
===
@RichDMay @Starphoenix26 @GailSimone Well, now it is my favourite as well.
===
@CBQPattyBoom @Starphoenix26 @GailSimone Thanks for letting me know
===
@GailSimone AMEN
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone I am a man of sophisticated taste. https://t.co/f5dfJujyDk
===
@GailSimone Aww. Gail...I mean, I could declare an unending war of vengeance between our two Houses if it will make you feel better...
===
@johnhartness @GailSimone I guess Supes has built-in speed dialing.
===
@pairofdicegreg @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone This comic was bad ass.
===
@GailSimone Same. I remember a couple of years ago everyone was like "Avengers Endgame" and I was like "Godzilla King of the Monsters", though. Those Saturday morning Creature Double Features on the UHF station were my childhood.
===
GAIL KNOWS. https://t.co/pZGx1UENdX
===
@cinphoria @GailSimone That actually going to have me thinking all day.
===
@GailSimone Maybe they could just go to the chemist and buy a laxative instead?
===
@BlumJordan @GailSimone I‚Äôm burning for that logo on a t-shirt.
===
@BlumJordan @GailSimone Dude! You are on fire!
===
@GailSimone There's still that hat guy from Australia
===
@GailSimone It's already out here IN THEATERS last thursday. I just don't have enough money for the ticket until the next pay üôÅ
===
@GailSimone Boooo! I paid tickets for this bout!
===
@GailSimone So nobody has to use or lift the phone when using internet there?
===
@PeteWriting Word arrangement's up to you.x
===
@PeteWriting chirrup.... sound made by banana-loving birdsüê¶
===
Confirmed: Comic book legend @GailSimone loves me back. https://t.co/3VcCzavWHC
===
@GailSimone I bet @VancityReynolds would make a worthy opponent.
===
@GailSimone Seems important to know what sort of feud you‚Äôre looking for.
===
Someone is asking for you @GailSimone. https://t.co/EHqhkaNZ56
===
@GailSimone We all do Gail, we all do
===
@GailSimone Hell yes!
===
@GailSimone ME TOO
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone An adaptation of Kurt Busiek and Alex Ross‚Äôs ‚ÄòMarvels‚Äô.
===
@Starphoenix26 @ComicsDrop @GailSimone That‚Äôs not what practical means.
===
@StickBoneKLN @Starphoenix26 @GailSimone That Otto Schmidt, not fan art. She used that for a lot of the original run of Birds of Prey.
===
@GailSimone I think you could take Bruce Willis.
===
@GailSimone It all comes down to how fast Barney Fite can get hisnlone bullet from his shirt pocket into the chamber.
===
@GailSimone Is Soupy Sales still alive? https://t.co/q9wrmuE6bR
===
Me all the time. Every single day. https://t.co/HYYP0FpKbm
===
@GailSimone How about Edge?  He starred in Money Plane.
===
@GailSimone The monster action is very Kong Skull Island.
===
@GailSimone Then you'll love the big showdown with you-know-who.  It's glorious.  And fight scenes are focused squarely on the monsters, with no cutaways to actors trying to be involved in the climax (that i saw, they were only snippets)
===
@GailSimone I've seen some leaks.

No spoilers but...you'll get it!

===
@GailSimone Who will you side with Gail, Godzilla or Kong?
===
@GailSimone When exactly did 'Kaiju' become the fancy word for 'giant monsters?' I never remember as a kid calling them that.
===
@GailSimone (In my best "In A World..." guy voice) IN TWO DAYS...
===
Same. https://t.co/Etyfy2HIng https://t.co/WzTA6H7K0T
===
@GailSimone I theorize that Chet is the result of a reverse ‚ÄòBig‚Äô deal where Tom used scrolls from ‚ÄòMazes &amp; Monsters‚Äô to stay young, but instead split him into a young good Tom (Colin) and a young bad Tom (Chet) and the Tom Hanks we know is really a hologram. You could feud with any of them!

@GailSimone The theme of so many great novels.

@GailSimone Would you be willing to take on the master feuder @LastWeekTonight

@GailSimone How about Atlas Bear? Or Porcelain?

@GailSimone What?

Really?

Since when???!!!!

@GailSimone How about Luke Wilson?

@GailSimone Ewan McGregor?

@GailSimone Only if this kaiju gets involved #TheSuicideSquad https://t.co/x7EkgJVgiG

@GailSimone I‚Äôve suggested Lou Ferrigno. Big, strong, many crimes against bears....I think you can build a long lasting blood feud, Gail.
===
@GailSimone DON'T WE ALL?!
===
@GailSimone We all want want to see kaiju beating the shit out of each other, we just want it to be over someone else's city.
===
@GailSimone Same, all day every day https://t.co/Mq5HkFGMcP

@GailSimone Did you read the wonderful Batman/Superman #16? Ivan Reis‚Äôs magnificent Spider Lady reminded me of how much the DCU needs Jeanette from Secret Six to return https://t.co/nAKcCIJlRe

@Yona_Korse @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Yes, pls!
===
@GailSimone I love those types of movies.
===
@MachinesEmbrace @WhoaBrotato @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone I have a trade.  Pretty good!
===
@GailSimone Fortress internet is really awful, Jor-El has to narrate every page.
===
@GailSimone KAIJU BEATING THE SHIT OUT OF EACH OTHER is playing at the drive-in starting Thursday!
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôd like to see them given access to education and assistance to help get them out of poverty so that they no longer have to pummel each other for our entertainment
===
@GailSimone Tom Hanks needs a nemesis? Seems fitting?
===
@GailSimone Tim Curry
===
@GailSimone It was me. I'm sorry, I took him from you. After he's done with me....avenge me!

https://t.co/SzCy9qJ5G4
===
@GailSimone OK BUT DON'T BEEF WITH GODZILLA GAIL, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.
===
@GailSimone Josh Groban. Actually just *the idea* of Josh Groban. 

He's completely fictitious and in no way a real person, I'm pretty sure.
===
@GailSimone Kevin Bacon. Think of the doors to other blood feuds that it could  open. He could set you up for blood feuds for the rest of your life.
===
@Tiamatnoir @GailSimone @pennjillette I would say Armie Hammer, but that could get weird real quick.
===
@GailSimone Literally my wedding vows.
===
@GailSimone No, just 2 hours of expositions and 10 minutes of fighting.
===
@GailSimone Mr. Rogers.
===
@wolvsterx @Kidfears99 @GailSimone Here, we have caps on drug prices (the highest amount which can be charged for a drug). That doesn't exist in the U.S.
The antibiotics I needed a couple of months ago were ‚Ç¨14 and covered by insurance. In the U.S. I would pay out of pocket over $300 for them.
===
@GailSimone In real life?
===
@GailSimone Well you an i got feud on stuff, one being that your really a bear
===
@GailSimone watch sentai/super sentai an power rangers to see kaiju

@GailSimone I'd suggest @VancityReynolds or @ScottAukerman. I think you could probably take either of them. They both put up a good front, but seem like they'd fold quickly.
===
@GailSimone Might I suggest Dwayne Johnson? Also a wrestler and he‚Äôs gonna be pushing the Marvel family around sooner or later. So, it‚Äôs an opportunity to prepare for the day you really need to be mad at him.
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Howard the Duck.

@GailSimone I think you're going about this the wrong way. Why end your blood feud w/ Cena? He made you laugh in the film trailer: use that as a reason to renew your rivalry! How dare he try to calm your rage with humor?! Does he not take this feud seriously?! Spite is a beautiful motivator
===
@Kidfears99 @GailSimone Pharmaceuticals, insurance companies, hospitals, doctors........

They are all taking advantage of the economic system that is ruining our nation.....capitalism.

Yes, they will argue that supply and demand is the driving factor for market prices, but that is a lie.

Still, I'm really happy to have had such amazing support thus far and I'll always keep working to bring our game to people. Never stop dreaming ‚ô•Ô∏è
===
@GailSimone King Shark bonked John Constantine and lived.
That means he's functionally immortal.
===
@GailSimone Probably still has a 9600 baud modem, too. And a rotary phone.
===
@GailSimone Ric Flair isn't doing much nowadays, I bet you could come up with a rousing blood feud for the Nature Boy.
===
@GailSimone Gail is the very essence of Monty Python's Argument sketch.
===
@GailSimone Nah, that thing is on starlink now!!!
===
@GailSimone The Iron Sheik?
===
@GailSimone Fjords? Feuds with fjords has a nice ring. Or, on the same basis, Flula Borg. He didn‚Äôt make anyone laugh in that trailer even though he‚Äôs way funnier than Idris Elba. Lazy on his part.
===
@GailSimone Salman Rushdie? You know how bears feel about Salman.
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôm pretty sure QAnon thinks Cyclops shoots deep state propaganda rays out of his eyes. You could help them learn the truth...
===
@GailSimone I suggest William Shatner...
===
@GailSimone Are you on good terms with Neil Gaiman ( @neilhimself )?

I feel like he would make a really great feud-mate.
===
@GailSimone Pam Ayres.

She may not look it, but she could punch a hole through the engine block of a Ford Mondeo without breaking a sweat.
===
@GailSimone I present the following for your consideration and possibly viewing pleasure https://t.co/tlze1Nep1R
===
@GailSimone Betty White?
===
@bestcbmtakes Not sure about a movie, but this poses would make a great series based on the run by @GailSimone and @david_baldeon https://t.co/SpBgi5SCnt
===
@GailSimone Have you considered @VancityReynolds

It‚Äôs still not done yet, but this should ‚Äòpaint‚Äô a good picture *wink wink

I gotta remember to do some nice stuff like that.

It‚Äôs so easy to get stuck in ‚Äòme mode‚Äô with all the work that needs done on our respective projects

===
@GailSimone How about @MitchGerads
===
@GailSimone üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôll do it
===
@GailSimone Arnie Hammer? No, he‚Äôd probably be too into it if there‚Äôs blood involved
===
@GailSimone I am no celebrity, but if you are willing to throw down anyway, that would soon change. ‚òùüèªü§î
===
@GailSimone @JamesUrbaniak is an evil mastermind (or he plays one on TV, same difference.)
===
@GailSimone You‚Äôre too nice to have a blood feud, you should start a nice feud with Henry Winkler to see who can be nicer.
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Next wave: Agents of HATE

We already have Monica Rambeau, so it's the next logical step. https://t.co/JKJCKCqbst
===
@devronius @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone YES

Back when that book came out, Amanda Seyfried was my casting choice for Boom Boom. 

Now? Howsabout @ChloeGMoretz ?
===
@devronius @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone @ChloeGMoretz And the rest of the cast, now I've got my bullshitcast head on?
Charlie Day as The Captain
@emeraldfennell as Elsa Bloodstone
Himesh Patel as Machine Man

Can't think who'd be Dirk Anger, though
===
@nathanielhardy @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone In development limbo. Along with rom and mask
===
@murderlinart @PFTompkins @GailSimone @PossibleCabbage I'd watch Paul and Gail feud for charity.
===
@dhacker615 @GailSimone Looks amazing in a tux. This alone is reason for a feud. (See A Simple Favour)
===
@GailSimone I hear Ranger Smith has time https://t.co/6xjFa0kLov

Who would win? @GailSimone @Rup_Grint  #bloodfeud

goodmorning

no Alexis waking up before 7pm????? replies my grandpa has that coveredüòí
===

===
@GailSimone We are accepting applications to join my blood feud with Orlando Bloom.
===
@GailSimone I was going to suggest Kirk Cameron but then I realized you specifically said ‚Äúcelebrities‚Äù so that won't work.....
===
@GailSimone How about Dalton Wilcox, Cowboy Poet Laureate of the West? https://t.co/0OxRJGydru
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone New Warriors - Original line up
===
@GailSimone In this blood feud are you the nice one or the other one?
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan ....that‚Äôs not @DoctorDC
===
@GailSimone I hear @DoctorDC are good for that.
===
@GailSimone Should try @GailSimone, I hear she‚Äôs a bit of a bear
===
@GailSimone He seems like a lovely guy! I could watch him talk about stuff all day üòÄ
===
@GailSimone hmmmm so another pro wrestler? I nominate @ShaneHelmsCom üòù
===
@GailSimone I'm not trying to start anything, but I definitely heard @RealLucyLawless talk smack about you. https://t.co/5vIy7IEozP

@GailSimone James Marsden.  He is Cyclops.

A really great week last week and a great week this week too hopefully! Thanks for asking! Yourself?
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Nova and I would make it.
===
@GailSimone James Marsden because he played cyclops.
===
@madeIeina @jillybobww @orcrist86 @GailSimone Also, how is lemon poppyseed a fun dessert? ;)
===
@puggalf @GailSimone He's too buys attending Sunday cult service.
===
@GailSimone @PossibleCabbage @PFTompkins No. Cyclops is your favorite. That is well established
===
@GailSimone In different replies I suggested Oprah &amp; Henry Winkler. I'll do so again and add as a suggestion Betty White. Why? Similar to Winkler, she can't be as nice as she appears
===
@GailSimone Those Kryptonian crystals are recycled AOL CDs https://t.co/Cor96Dx9Dv
===
@GailSimone Transfer the Blood Feud to Stallone.

Rambo vs The GailBear

Or...

Go after Oprah. Why? While she's great in many ways she's also partially responsible for unleashing both Dr. Phil AND Dr. Oz on the masses. There must be a reckoning for that.
===
@GailSimone I'll repeat. Oprah for inflicting Drs. Phil &amp; Oz on us all.

Or maybe Henry Winkler. He can't actually be that nice, can he?
===
@GailSimone @JamesGunn It must be said that @GailSimone is bear https://t.co/d8bgzNuGtq
===
@JamesGunn @GailSimone Gail's gonna maul you.....when she wakes up https://t.co/MYyf55TaMU
===
@GailSimone LeVar Burton has gotten away with too much for too long. 
(Much love to Mr. Burton.)
===
@GailSimone The only answer is @the_ironsheik
===
@GailSimone I volunteer, I have no chance of making you laugh so our battle will be legendary!
===
@GailSimone Is @StephenAtHome available?
===
@GailSimone Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Gosling blood feuds are in season.
===
@GailSimone well, it depends.  If you want to punch-clock this blood feud, I'd recommend John Oliver of @LastWeekTonight 

If you want to go for the throat, then a republican politician.
===
@GailSimone I think Tom Hanks has been getting away with it way too long, Gail
===
@GailSimone I'd suggest Chris Pratt but he breaks too fast.
===
You can keep avoiding the OBVIOUS CHOICE but...
@JimGaffigan https://t.co/v2TI8RLqsI
===
@GailSimone You can keep avoiding the OBVIOUS CHOICE but...
@JimGaffigan
===
@GailSimone I'd love to see the bear poke @ksorbs
===
@GailSimone I think Russell Crowe would be ready to have a go.
===
@AkodoRokku @madeIeina @GailSimone Yeah, plus Blake seems like a nice lady, and she‚Äôs a mom. Don‚Äôt pick on someone‚Äôs mom!
===
@GailSimone I have heard Thom Yorke thinks you smell
===
@GailSimone Me. I live far away enough that the risk is low.
===
@GailSimone I'd love to be your new blood feud but I just don't think I could stay mad at you.
===
I never did get that @TomTaylorMade you were offering. Perhaps I should call for revenge? https://t.co/5cDB1nkfeY
===
@kellysue @1moreGaryFrank @EoinHiggins_ Have you not already had @GailSimone over for coffee? I'd listen to that podcast.
===
@GailSimone Groot. He can regrow, can make his arm a spare &amp; stab King Shark, then slam him all around.
===
@HawkZombie @GailSimone Groot grows back and do you remember when he goes all savage https://t.co/4zE7kVI1dz
===
@StickBoneKLN @Starphoenix26 @GailSimone That looks like the full-length version of the 90s Chuck Dixon-era redesign. It's a personal favourite. https://t.co/GN9KuvkpBk
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Wildcat or Gambit Movie
===
@GailSimone The first Rob anyone will think of in this context? :D
===
@GailSimone Steve, fuck that guy.
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan Yaknow‚Ä¶I have the weird feeling @CrackMcCraigen gives good blood feud. ü§î

Just a hunch. https://t.co/LzXyC8XMQC
===
@GailSimone Kids giving you trouble on an otherwise grand day out? https://t.co/tTPmchkxr2
===
@GailSimone Try Barnes and Noble, I‚Äôve seen it there multiple times in recent weeks.
===
@GailSimone Cuteness, coolness, power?
===
@PHOENIXZERO @LgndsOfAvalance @GailSimone Yah, that's too bad. Matt is great in the role.
===
Groot quien? https://t.co/KHXbx3jBok https://t.co/lfsDPcJ0wH
===
@imyerhero @GailSimone I mean he is a rapist and abuser so maybe an actual feud and not a funny one
===
@GailSimone King Shark is a shark
===
@TheDevi72035616 @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone @Marvel @Sony X-Men were Fox and now the mouse own it. Patience. Feige is working it out. I can't see them not be in MCU by the end of this phase. He's got 20 years of sub-par films to work around!
===
King Shark would bite Groot in half but then he would just regrow back and strangle him. https://t.co/Vp4NU8dNVs
===
@RochesterIrish @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone @jurneesmollett @Lexialex Get on this, @Marvel!

...

What do you mean you don't have the rights?
===
@GailSimone I don't know King Shark at all. Are we talking about movie Groot or comic Groot?
===
@GailSimone And all those data crystals they use in the movies are just reconfigured 3 1/4 floppies.

===
@Myrmidon2002 @Starphoenix26 @GailSimone The savagery--- who drew this?
===
@Leopard24601 @crystarius @ghosthermione @Starphoenix26 @GailSimone I don't think her uniform is inherently "sexed up" tho but rather it's about she (and numerous other heroines) are drawn.
===
@mseraphimsl @HalTotoro87 @Leopard24601 @Starphoenix26 @GailSimone Lol.
I remember one of the reasons being that she wasn't sure what insignia to use. ?? How about a big ol P??
===
@Myrmidon2002 @Starphoenix26 @GailSimone Too bad :( its not so bad,could've used some minor adjustments bit the regular suit is GOLDEN!
===
@GailSimone Can I suggest one of those young, moronic right wing internet personalities?
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Oh...only Secret Wars the original. https://t.co/t9Wc4K0iBK
===
@GailSimone The fans.
===
@GailSimone @PossibleCabbage @PFTompkins "What is this, a crossover feud?"
===
@GailSimone When Cena came on during the trailer, I said "Oh no, Gail will be upset." I'm glad your experience wasn't ruined and the feud has ended.
===
@GailSimone Better option is
===
@cotereb @GailSimone Even if king shark did eat Groot, Groot would just kill him from the inside.
===
@GailSimone What parameters must be met for said blood feud?
===
@GailSimone *jigsaw music intensifies.* https://t.co/IJT0ngzPpu
===
@HumBadger @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone The time he made things so much worse by trying to raise Thanos to not grow up to not be a genocidal mad titan.
===
@damien_a_p @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Would love it if Boom Boom was the intro of the X-Men to the MCU tbh
===
@GailSimone We, the fans do.
===
@GailSimone I hear @TomTaylorMade is available
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone AvX 
How good would that be...
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Squirrel Girl.

What's your #BoardGamersLift news this week?

===
@GailSimone I can volunteer as a temp until your new feud calling emerges
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone *Next Wave
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Squirrel Girl and New wave have already been mentioned but I‚Äôd add propose adding some new threads of movies to the MCU to lead to Thunderbolts and A-Force/Lady Liberators movies.
===
@bestcbmtakes 4. Spirits of Vengeance
3. All-New Wolverine
2. @GailSimone's Hotshots
1. Marvel Now's Thunderbolts
===
@GailSimone only if it's Stallone
===
Groot, he is a tree god from Planet X, he can take on any shark-man-thingy easily https://t.co/4nB3BqW8bR
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone New Howard the Duck!
===
@Kidfears99 @GailSimone D3, magnesium, and metformin XR could help a lot to control and decrease diabets. If use them drink a lot of water (2,5 l per day). And correct doses. Look for Coimbra Protocol.
===
@Kidfears99 @GailSimone And  no way your fight for lower prices are wrong. You are doing very well. But D3 could help you a lot. And lowering the insulin tax needed for treatment.
===
@GailSimone Have you met the Prime Minister of Australia?
===
@otakuconjabon @Sunosis @JacksonLanzing @GailSimone they are best friends that have sister like bond.the original creator made lara straight
===
@EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone But on the plus-side Shark Fin Soup for everyone!
===
@GailSimone He may be prickly but Groot is the best hugger.
===
@GailSimone but is John Cena ending his blood feud with you?
===
We win https://t.co/hBA7DEfNMk
===
@GailSimone It‚Äôs unbearable
===
@GailSimone Assuming it's the adult version, I'd say Groot.
===
@GailSimone Doc Savage's place or Superman's?
===
@BrianWFoster @GailSimone Gail Simone vs Brian W. Foster? The verbal combat Between the Sheets I always wanted and never got? https://t.co/iR0GtEdZXU
===
@GailSimone Randy Orton likes a good beef.
===
@GailSimone Might I nominate @TomTaylorMade?
===
@GailSimone Maybe a blood feud with #Monopoly? 

The worst board game ever. 

That Uncle Moneybags needs to be taken down a peg or two!
===
@GailSimone Shark beats tree.
DC beats Marvel.
Sly Stallone beats Vin Diesel.

Hat trick, no contest. https://t.co/8gGiTkJU3D
===
@GailSimone King Shark could chomp on Groot, but Groot could just grow back.
===
@GailSimone Have you ever fended with @gailsimone? I hear she's got views on heat vision...
===
@GailSimone Jason Statham is probably available to feud with.
===
Get out of town https://t.co/TTcv474ApT
===
@MKEthelife4me @HawkZombie @GailSimone This is glorious üòÇ
===
@GailSimone King Shark: "HAND"

Groot: "I AM GROOT"

Rocket Raccoon: "IDIOTS"
===
@GailSimone Sticking with wrestling, consider MJF?
===
@GailSimone fine, I volunteer
===
@Jim_Nightshade_ @GailSimone Prue Leith should be in that package deal as well?
===
@GailSimone So is my hotel it seems. Oh, the horror of hotel without internet! *Grips smart phone in death grasp*
===
@GailSimone Start another one. With who, i don‚Äôt know.
===
@GailSimone Whoever you pick, just put pictures of Scarlett Johansson as if she has been cast to play them.
===
@BrianWFoster @GailSimone an interesting pairing f'sure 
i believe in you
===
@GailSimone Can... can I be your new blood feud? Please? I‚Äôll like say mean things and cackle manically. https://t.co/PQi6CMlmNH
===
kong wins https://t.co/YJ9gwp2pJU
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan Wait...does that make you the heel in this match up? You‚Äôve already surprised Cena then! It‚Äôs the one thing he could never do...a heel turn &gt;:D
===
@GailSimone I too need a blood feud.
===
@GailSimone I would volunteer but my clapback game is so weak these days, you‚Äôd have to feud with my feud skills and then it gets all meta.
===
@PFTompkins @GailSimone @PossibleCabbage i think u guys should still feud it out for the pay per view money
===
@GailSimone @PossibleCabbage I‚Äôm relieved, frankly
===
@GailSimone I was wondering...
===
@ScottKumka @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone @Marvel @DCComics YES. It should be a series of one-shots. And just like Marvel published some of the Amalgam books and DC published others (I think that's how it worked, at least), Disney+ could do some characters and HBOMax could do others.
===
@GailSimone Groot, on the basis of fish can't climb trees
===
@BlumJordan @GailSimone Oh, feud because you're normal, oh no.
===
@GailSimone @79SemiFinalist You guys already have shark beef so why not escalate?
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Adapting West Coat Avengers by @79SemiFinalist . Its my favorite comic series
===
@GailSimone How about @NicolaScottArt ?
===
@BlumJordan @GailSimone His heat vision burns Gail's blood! https://t.co/SxqBJMRUDT
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone X-MEN! Can you and Sony just figure that out? Forget the money, this story is needed right here right now. We have never hated each other more and are at the precipice of either a Holocaust or a Renaissance. What you say that we pick the latter

@Marvel @Sony
===
@GailSimone Take on another wrestler in the dc universe @TheRock
===
@GailSimone *whispers* it‚Äôs totally King Shark....
===
@GailSimone @SamSeder. You can view his resume on YouTube where there are clips of his feud with Tim Heidecker and H. Jon Benjamin
===
@GailSimone There would be no fight. Both would immediately introduce and describe themselves, and there's virtually no chance that politics, religion, or Piano Man would come up to encourage hostility
===
Someone feud with Gail! Cena is a no show, and all the Sonic fans are too busy trying to convince their kids that there used to be good Sonic games. https://t.co/BCyP3gPJuR
===
@GailSimone Have you tried posting "Batman LOVES guns"? It would probably be the TV dinner of blood feuds, but it might tide you over
===
@BlumJordan @GailSimone (Battle horn sounds) https://t.co/4keFUMA6sX
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôll feud Gail. Don‚Äôt be sad.

===
@ziggiedogg @shmermel @GailSimone What newbie nonsense is this? 8" or nothing.
===
@ziggiedogg @shmermel @GailSimone Punch cards are and remain awesome. There was something relaxing about hearing the "brrrrrrrrrup!" sound as they were blown through the card reader.

Heavy suckers though, once you got a pile of them done.
===
@GailSimone Dwayne Johnson hates bears...
===
@shmermel @GailSimone You mean 5 1/4, of course.
===
@CPANJGamble @shmermel @GailSimone It‚Äôs a fad. Punch cards will come back, you‚Äôll see.
===
@GailSimone Considering our internet has been out for an hour, I‚Äôd love that nasty modem sound right about now.
===
@Tanya_R_Steele @GailSimone As one should do.

I can fight away the pain.
I will stand by you forever
In a blood feud that will take your breath away.
===
@GailSimone Good natured, or visceral hatred?
===
@GailSimone Come on. Groot always wins because he always grows back...eventually. It‚Äôs like Swamp Thing and Solomon Grundy.
===
@GailSimone To be fair Mod-Em is a fine traditional Kryptonian name

@GailSimone He uses AOL messenger when he wants to chat with Bruce.

@GailSimone End of an era

@lachwriter @JosephGlass @GailSimone @ChrisShehanArt @kirameks @SergAcuna @spacejamkamart @sambeckdraws @BrianLHawkins @FellHound_ It looks like a cool project, least I can do

I give it less than 48 and it's funded, heck probably 12-14
===
@lachwriter @JosephGlass @GailSimone @ChrisShehanArt @kirameks @SergAcuna @spacejamkamart @sambeckdraws @BrianLHawkins @FellHound_ Don't trip bro, she gon' get funded.

Imma back it a bit later though
===
@PeteWriting Me too !
===
@GailSimone Since King Shark is Water Type, and Groot is Grass Type, I'm going to give the win to Groot. He has the advantage.

@GailSimone Superman just wants to look at the memes Batman makes.

@spaceman9k @chickey253 @EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Only some fish have bones. Sharks do not, although the cartilage they have would look like bone when dried out.
===
@GailSimone Wait - when did you blood feud with @TomTaylorMade and @JohnCena end?
===
@GailSimone Take me
===
@GailSimone You know, I don't even think this is trolling. I totally buy this as canon.
===
Imagine how long it would take to download the Superman 64 ROM...!!! https://t.co/SSCnLn73hd
===
@GailSimone I'll have a blood feud with you so you don't feel lost üòä
===
@GailSimone Can we feud? ü•∫
===
@GailSimone Uri Geller. That way if you ever trip over or drop something, you can scream to the heavens "DAMN YOU, URI!" Because he probably made you do it psychically.
===
@GailSimone I hate burritos.
===
@GailSimone I'm sorry, that was a lie. I was just trying to cheer you up. I could really go for a burrito right about now.
===
@GailSimone Hard to get fiber optic lines in the middle of frozen tundra. Expensive too.
===
@GailSimone Sometimes he has to use a giant paperclip to do a manual reset of his giant dial up modem.
===
@GailSimone Nothing will ever surpass the quality of the floppy disc
===
@GailSimone this is not cannon
===
@GailSimone James Gunn was covering for John Cena.  You could pick him.
===
@GailSimone @JamesGunn I think he covers for Cena too.
===
OMG IT LOOKS SO GOOD TY https://t.co/9mIwHs6sIF
===
@GailSimone *Air Supply voice*

üé∂ I'm all out of guff
I'm so lost without feuds...üé∂
===
@GailSimone @JamesGunn He's a real son of a Gunn.
===
@GailSimone Hmm, I'm a bit busy but maybe I can squeeze in some light blood feuding on Thursdays?
===
@GailSimone Kal-El is a 5G truther
===
@GailSimone ~Quick stop at the Gail and off to dreamland.
===
@GailSimone You... could could blood feud with me if you want.
===
@GailSimone Comic-Con is kinda begging for a beating...
===
@PaulCPace @GailSimone This made me laugh harder than it should have
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Squirrel Girl
===
@GailSimone Was he in the suicide squad trailer? I couldn't see him ü§î
===
@GailSimone I hereby declare a blood feud against this here ornery bear-woman.
===
@GailSimone What about a Kool Aid feud?
===
@GailSimone Pretty sure you find a new feud
===
@_mjwills @GailSimone Depending on the version? The Harley Quinn show version would absolutely trounce, heck he'd likely beat most humans in a spelling bee.

In the comics? He'd win against Groot but uh
... it'd be closer than it should be.
===
@mjonesonline @GailSimone @BlumJordan @pattonoswalt Yeah... I don't think I'd be messing with Meredith Salenger. She seems lovely but she can throw a punch.
===
@GailSimone King Shark, of course. https://t.co/L8S2yLjWbb
===
@GailSimone As your blood feud I will respond to all of your public posts with, ‚ÄúNo, Gail! No!‚Äù.

And all replies directly to me with, ‚ÄúPfft... as if.‚Äù

However if you choose me for your blood feud I will immediately resign since you want me as your blood feud and I won‚Äôt be able to abide.
===
@GailSimone @JamesGunn Let me tell you about The Last Easter Egg.
===
@GailSimone I could be your blood feud.

Does it come with any health insurance?
===
@GailSimone A proper nemesis really gives you reason to get up in the morning and puts pep in your step. https://t.co/NJhnCbYtrL
===
@hadriewyn @GailSimone What???
===
@GailSimone There, there, Gail. Hehe
===
@GailSimone You can use the Vantablack guy as a substitute until you find a new one. I know we're all using him, but there's enough blood feud to go around in that case.
===
@GailSimone Cyclops is an eternal, not a mutant.
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôm not busy. How do you feel about themed Oreos cookies? I‚Äôll take the opposite position.
===
@jaksplat @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone He'd be awesome.  He has the energy!

I have a whole crossover comic series idea placing Deadpool and Punisher on a Mojo controlled Pandora.

(The Pandora of the Borderlands series.)

Now if I ever got to write it, I wouldn't be able to do Mojo without Jables in my head. üòÇ Cool.
===
@meneldir @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone I developed an idea once.

Team: Cap, Bucky, Namor the Sub-Mariner, og android Human Torch, w Brits Union Jack, Spitfire, &amp; Peggy.
v
Masters of Evil: og Zemo &amp; Black Knight, Radioactive Man, Melter, maybe a Strucker, Enchantress &amp; Executioner, Immortus

/the Steve that got Peggy

@GailSimone we can have one about how to make tea and it would be with a fellow ginger
===
@KonanTheDarth @Starphoenix26 @GailSimone Brian Bolland, his sig is on the left hand side.   It's the cover to Action Comics weekly #608. Fan reaction was poor to this suit.
===
@newageamazon @GailSimone * Ahem *

‚Ä¶#HollaHolla
===
@GailSimone Microwave some tea and I'm sure you'll have one soon enough
===
@Kidfears99 @GailSimone Either way I'm so angry on your behalf. Having to pay tostay alive is insane! 
I'm sorry this is happening to you!
===
@Kidfears99 @GailSimone Please forgive my ignorance. I'm so confused.

Is this a US problem? Because it appears that the cost of this insulin is still ‚Ç¨21 in The Netherlands.
What causes the price to go up so drastically in the USA? 

Not sure if we're talking about the same thing so added a screenshot https://t.co/Fw8ZyrYHym

@GailSimone Hey Gail, does Superman have a belly button?
===
@GailSimone Have you considered #Coliver yet?
https://t.co/rvzggjc2vW

@GailSimone I'm assuming it's a dance off... https://t.co/23JSlJmOEx
===
@GailSimone @StephenAtHome @iamjohnoliver And then celebrating that laugh with champagne. üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° That otta do it... #Coliver gotta be your new nemesis! üò°üò°üò°üò°üò° https://t.co/1wzJ0drfmm
===
@GailSimone @StephenAtHome, a known pro-bear (assuming his persona on #ColbertReport was opposite of his real self) or/and @iamjohnoliver, a well known hater of all good things. I'd say go for both, I see them laughing at you... https://t.co/rDKC2o1DNK
===
@GailSimone Girl, find you a nemesis who will value you for the lineage they want to destroy.
===
@GailSimone Symphony of the Night is the best Contra game.
===
@GailSimone I think you could totally take Michael Cera and Cera is prettttty close to Cena
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan Go for MODOK himself. @pattonoswalt ... granted while he may be a pushover his wife looks fierce.
===
@GailSimone I nominate Bear Grylis because I feel his name is simply a long game of mocking you.
===
@cinphoria @GailSimone Cin you sure about this?
===
@Kidfears99 @GailSimone Just tried to calculate this for India. I can see 3ml cartridge available for Rs700. So for 70ml it will be ~Rs16000. Not a small amount for India, but around USD230, so 1/10th of the cost shown here.
===
@GailSimone How about George? https://t.co/jdHER6XTN9
===
@GailSimone Ahem.  King Shark is over rated and the best Bird of Prey is anyone not in the Birds of Prey.
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan I say, honestly, get a phone book for Prague, and pick a name.
===
@GailSimone Start one with @RahulKohli13
===
@GailSimone Aww I'm sorry Gail. Maybe this will help https://t.co/xa6juwj7eZ
===
@GailSimone Did you ever settle that whole "Cyclops has heat vision" thing? (Sorry, I checked out...)
===
@GailSimone Groot is Groot but King Shark? He's a shark, baybay.
===
@GailSimone You'll always have Cyclops.
===
@GailSimone Has to be someone we can see
===
@GailSimone Fight @GatorsDaily
===
@GailSimone I'd offer myself as a rhetorical sparring partner but I don't want to be exsanguinated by a literal bear.
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan Seems fair
===
@GailSimone Get something going with Paul Dini?
===
@GailSimone Pick a fight with William Gibson or Margaret Atwood. I'm sure both would come out to play.
===
@GailSimone Oh, Gail, I'm sure there's *someone* out there whose wrong on the Internet for you to light up.
===
@GailSimone I bet you could get @perlmutations to lace em up
===
@GailSimone Too bad there isn't an Etrigan movie so that you could have a Jason Blood feud with the lead actor.
===
@GailSimone Have a blood feud with Jack Black. He's great and I feel like he would participate with a good sense of fair play.
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone @GailSimone Kills the Marvel Universe
===
@madeIeina @GailSimone ah ok im familiar woth that debacle
===
@madeIeina @GailSimone wait what am i missing
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone New Warriors.

But the original group, not later versions.
===
@GailSimone Just wait until he plays Cyclops...
===
@GailSimone John Cena was in the Suicide Squad trailer? I didn't see him.
===
@GailSimone "I am Groot."
"King Shark is a shark."

Seems like a stalemate.
===
@GailSimone Like, in a rap battle? Because that would be fire.

@GailSimone How about a politician? https://t.co/Zg6dZHQfBi

@GailSimone What about Mark Duplass?
===
@GailSimone @JamesGunn He‚Äôs as mean as King Shark is smooth
===
@GailSimone A Simple Favor, go watch, it‚Äôs so good
===
@GailSimone Are you *just* looking for a feud or do you want the full ‚Äúfeudin‚Äô and a-fussin‚Äô‚Äù package, which is priced a bit higher but is much more comprehensive?
===
@GailSimone Tell everyone you‚Äôre feuding with Neil Gaiman and then at the last second BOOM switch it to Neil Diamond, neither will see it coming
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends.
===
@DnDGeologist @GailSimone That's simple math right there, can't go wrong.
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan Is this feud sustainable?
===
@IgnisTwote @GailSimone YES HOTSHOTS!!!

@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Laal Khangeer!

@BrianHezza @LauraBaileyVO @WillingBlam @GailSimone @kellysue Hee!

Being in Star Wars gets you in the nerd club, I should think
===
@GailSimone I volunteer as tribute.

I'm not famous or anything I'm just filled with rage and always wanted to be a queer coded villain.
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan Too soon? https://t.co/qm7WfLYH09
===
@track1971 @GailSimone No can do, Stallone is the voice of king shark
===
@GailSimone I nominate @pattonoswalt, because I love you both and I know they fiery Tweets would be hilarious. https://t.co/3eofn5KlD6
===
@GailSimone @pattonoswalt He does have MODOK powers... but the Tweet battle would totally be epic.
===
@GailSimone How about @TheRock?

Since he's Black Adam, you may as well go big. It keeps with the wrestler-actor theme.
===
@GailSimone @TheRock I also recommend my friend @LassGene for a bloodfeud. 

I overheard him telling his wife that Black Canary has a run in her fishnet stockings and should wear spanx instead. 

He's that petty. I know you can't let that slide.
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôm free tuesdays and Thursday‚Äôs if that‚Äôs of any use to you
===
@EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Groot could extend his arm through king starks skull if he wanted

@chickey253 @EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Fish have bones so I assumed

@the_jawa @GailSimone "I am Groot."

@dhacker615 @GailSimone Gossip Girl is the other teen show.
===
@Silverjojo08 @GailSimone Wow, you trully hate her. Reminding someone as X from that... 'movie'
===
@Silverjojo08 @GailSimone TBF, it was entertaining, certaionly (for me, personal opinion) more than Man of Steel and Batman v Superman. I was mostly joking from the terrible reviews it got.
===
@JEffinghamBellw @GailSimone Underappreciated tweet. Here are some internet points from me.
===
@GailSimone Debate me! 

Er, I mean...

Fight me!
===
@madeIeina @GailSimone What‚Äôs wrong with Blake Lively??
===
@GailSimone deadpool's irl wife! https://t.co/6UFXhJxBnm
===
@GailSimone ok but consider... @samriegel
===
@GailSimone I'd suggest @JamesMarsdenOff . You've been training for this for years.
===
@navydadwax @ethancushing @GailSimone @ScottAukerman @threedomusa Is that you Carl? You sniveling worm ...
===
@GailSimone Cary Elwes

@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Squirrel Girl for sure, and then Gwenpool. https://t.co/EqJYfUdGt4
===
@jaksplat @bestcbmtakes @GailSimone now im having a hard time imagining anyone else
my first thought was actually Gilbert Godfrey as his voice but i like your idea better

Charlize Theron as Rita?
===
@GailSimone Stanley Tucci seems like such a great person to have a feud with. It also means that you get to be the villain.
===
@GailSimone The real answer is "whoever the writer wants to"
===
@GailSimone If you have one with the Red Hot Chili Peppers it gives you the option to diversify into sugar, sex and magik feuds.
===
@spaceman9k @EvaIsAdorable @GailSimone Do sharks technically have skulls?
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan He'll never expect the sudden onsalught of bear claws
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan uhhh not if you tag him first. come on gail this is what sun tzu was talking about
===
@GailSimone Paul Hollywood is deserving.   Allotting handshakes like they're some sort of award.
It's a handshake Paul... c'mon
===
@GailSimone James Gunn seems the obvious choice.
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Avengers: The Initiative
Dark Avengers

@puckett101 @GailSimone Put that on a t shirt!

@GailSimone Tom Taylor and Tom King 
Gail the bear vs two twin toms

@GailSimone @BlumJordan "Win if you can, lose if you must, but always cheat."
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan I still don't think Tom Taylor has learned his lesson
===
@GailSimone She seems lovely. *shrugs*
===
@GailSimone @JamesGunn Maybe you should start a blood feud with him.
===
@GailSimone She‚Äôs also in that Oliver Stone film where she‚Äôs in love with both Taylor Kitsch and Aaron Taylor Johnson.
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan Please no? https://t.co/WBmn1jUGj4
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan It would be a little quirky if we had a blood feud tho 

   üò≥
üëâüëà
===
@Morgoth136 @GailSimone So you could be feuding with ...

The Tom Tom Club?
===
@GailSimone Her siblings are also well known 80s actors, Jason and Robyn Lively.
===
@GailSimone I'll feud blood wit' cha, ma'am! https://t.co/fjDofWcaBx
===
@GailSimone @BlumJordan Gail. https://t.co/Qon4wWv659
===
@GailSimone Ron Howard probably has a spot open on his dance card.
===
@GailSimone Known pest @zdarsky please. Thank you.
===
@GailSimone I think it should be with @hankgreen 
He could make tik toks.
===
@GailSimone That was probably Cena's plan to avoid a righteous stomping.
===
@GailSimone You should feud with John Oliver, that'd be fun for all of us, I think.
===
@GailSimone hey Gail ‚Äî could I ask you a favor to boost my PayPal for a big medical bill?  Thanks either way.  Here‚Äôs the link to the tweet. https://t.co/gwfMkl6DFm
===
@GailSimone thank you so much Gail ‚Äî much appreciated ‚Äî it‚Äôs hell to have medical bills.
===
@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone X-men X-tinction Agenda. Jump right in, tell the origins and background in flashbacks.
===
@GailSimone People getting all analytical about this. Groot‚Äôs a nice guy, pretty chill, only gets mean when he‚Äôs worked up. King Shark is a shark, rips people in half &amp; (as trailer suggests) eats them whole. Physically it‚Äôs a mismatch, but it depends on whether he‚Äôs fighting Big/Baby Groot.
===
@GailSimone @StephenAtHome - notorious fan of high fantasy and comic books, publicly defamed bears on his previous show on frequent occasions. Also likely to reciprocate and perpetuate blood feud for the foreseeable future.
===
@GailSimone Trick question. Dancing Baby Groot. https://t.co/euPdwRwm8C
===
@HelaKarp @GailSimone Unless they tricked King Shark to eat his bomb, they probably pierced the skin to put the cranial bomb in his head.
===
@GailSimone Water or forest venue?
===
@GailSimone Yeah, I do to.
===
@GailSimone Ryan Reynold‚Äôs wife.  Played Carol Ferris in Green Lantern.  Was in The Town and on some teen show.
===
@GailSimone Can you please retweet this? https://t.co/nVsu5zoXR7
===
@NateTBD @ctheokas @GailSimone I never liked the idea of pitting Big G vs. Kong. MUCH rather have them tag-team something else.  ;)

Pretty sure most the Kaiju fandom is roughly similar in this, whether or not they have a favorite.
===
@GailSimone I'd offer but I'm not popular enough
===
@GailSimone I can pencil you in next sunday but its gonna be tight
===
@GailSimone I volunteer, but can it be a cherry jello feud instead?
===
@jillybobww @GailSimone What the FUCK is that.

@orcrist86 @jillybobww @GailSimone Why is there challah I‚Äôm going to scream

@_Snark_Attack @GailSimone Plantation wedding.

@GailSimone You live a blissful life.

@TheWire2 @GailSimone More, I say!

@vaultground @GailSimone How and why did I have no idea they were sisters? Omg
===
@jillybobww @orcrist86 @GailSimone ‚ÄúWhy on this night do we eat a ‚Äòfun dessert‚Äô?‚Äù
===
@GailSimone Blake Lively. She‚Äôs just... bothersome.
===
@GailSimone Seems time to deal with your evil doppelg√§nger from the negative mirror-verse.

Or are you just going to keep ignoring that whole situation, and hope it resolves itself?
===
@GailSimone May I suggest Fabian Nicieza although he‚Äôll probably call it a kinetic feud.
===
In a fight, I‚Äôm pretty sure King Shark would choke on a Groot splinter and lose. 
 In a dance battle it‚Äôs not even close. Groot wins by a mile. https://t.co/dnB1Chn0Qd https://t.co/U2QeKwyIIw
===
@GailSimone TOM. HANKS.
===
@GailSimone If you're having trouble picking on a senior citizen, may I suggest Bradley Cooper?

@GailSimone Go big or go home.

@GailSimone What kind of question is this? https://t.co/2rbdurbQJE

@GailSimone Personally, I blame, and haven't forgiven, sony for the end of the dreamcast/sega so I'll have that my whole life until climate change or The Revolution
===
@GailSimone When she was in Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants I thought she'd make an awesome Cassie Sandsmark for a Teen Titans live action movie.
===
@GailSimone I've got a full plate, but I could probably arrange some rousing contrarian tweets for ya now and then
===
@GailSimone Kevin Smith
===
@GailSimone King Shark is a crustacean.

BRING IT!
===
@IgnisTwote @GailSimone Why are Widow's hands glowing in this?
===
@GailSimone Have you considered having a blood feud with a philosophical concept?
===
@GailSimone Out of curiosity, was John Cena ever aware of this blood feud?
===
@GailSimone How can Groot possibly lose this? https://t.co/6mo743te6w
===
@GailSimone Groot. He can alter his size, so he could grow to 50-60 feet, and ironically break King Shark over his knee like a twig.
===
@GailSimone She was Carol in the Green Lantern movie
===
@harigtt @GailSimone Hot take: it wasn't that bad lol

I mean it certainly wasn't GOOD, but still. I've seen worse.
===
@OtakuNuts @GailSimone So far this is the best answer
===
@GailSimone We do.

@madeIeina @GailSimone Look I know we're all in love with Ryan Reynolds, but it's just not fair to sick Gail on somebody.

@GailSimone Quitter..... LOL
===
@GailSimone I'd say me, but people would pile on you for fighting with a dog.
===
@GailSimone Seems like the middle of March Madness might be a good time for a blood feud tournament. 

Anyone have a bracket template?
===
@GailSimone I'm more into a choler feud or maybe a melancholy feud, but okay I'm game.
===
@GailSimone Huge props to you for a long vendetta
with someone invisible.

If you know what I mean.

@madeIeina @GailSimone She got pinned on a rock by a shark she‚Äôs been though enough

@IgnisTwote @GailSimone When do I order a ticket?

@IgnisTwote @GailSimone I would watch the HELL out of that!

@GailSimone Weren't you still in one with @TomTaylorMade?

I remember that being a thing.

Tho, it's hard to keep up with all your blood feuds.
===
@GailSimone I‚Äôm pretty good at holding grudges if you want a blood feud with me
===
@GailSimone The most important thing to know about Blake Lively is that you can use her name as an announcement for an old timey British policeman and it fits perfectly.

"WOT'S ALL THIS THEN?!? STOP ALL THAT MUCKIN' ABOUT! BLAKE LIVELY, WOT WOT!"

@GailSimone It was a beach of dicks, wasn't it.

@GailSimone Go for @VancityReynolds. It'd would be the best blood feud twitter has ever seen (or will see).

@GailSimone Can you feud with blood?

@RevilFox @GailSimone Sharks will also eat tires

@GailSimone I‚Äôd recommend myself, but keeping up with a blood feud sounds exhausting.  I can‚Äôt currently commit.

@GailSimone @JamesGunn If James Gunn was truly mean, he‚Äôd regularly do mean things like call Gambit a NARC.

@GailSimone Bears?

Good god, internet. Please come to your senses. https://t.co/mBaEWGB77L

@GailSimone I nominate Ted Cruz.

@GailSimone What about your blood feud with Tom Taylor?

@GailSimone But how can you end a feud with @JohnCena if no one can see him? ü§î

@GailSimone May I suggest pick-a-nick baskets?

@GailSimone Might I suggest Bear Simone? Unless....

@GailSimone Ok, fine. I reluctantly accept
===
@GailSimone Groot is the only right answer
===
Which Groot are we talking about? Comic Groot would obliterate the new TSS Shark.

Nanue, king of the ocean, would body Groot https://t.co/bKJKboUp1U

@bestcbmtakes @GailSimone Squirrel Girl.

@GailSimone Depends on what they‚Äôre playing.
===
@JamesGunn @GailSimone Using pokemon logic grass is super effective against water so groot wins
===
#KingShark FTW. His feats are stupid high if written correctly! https://t.co/2En1ONW59e https://t.co/YJ89fIkG91

I honestly think Groot would win lol https://t.co/5MN1aCb19H
===
@carlosd0220 @GailSimone Nonsense, then what are these card sharks I hear about? Cards made from paper made from trees.
===
@cotereb @GailSimone Sorry to break it to you but, sharks don‚Äôt eat trees.
===
@Silverjojo08 @Lonelystarrd22 @GailSimone Didn‚Äôt Groot protect the guardians from a spaceship crash from orbit? I‚Äôd say pretty high defense for Groot too.

@JamesGunn and @GailSimone teaming on a Secret Six project when!? https://t.co/fG52K6EVLk
===
@GailSimone He's a Shark!
===
@JamesGunn @GailSimone Of course you do! üòÉ
===
@GailSimone We know from Gail's Twitter feed that King Shark is a shark. And we know from Shark Week that sharks eat meat. My sources have told me, and this is unconfirmed, that Groot is a tree. But there's no Tree Week, so we don't know what trees eat, making declaring a winner impossible.
===
@GailSimone @JamesGunn He simply is trying to spare your feelings Gail. by not giving an answer he doesnt have to inform you that King Shark, is in fact, not a shark.
===
@GailSimone Here's the thing... Groot's functionally immortal and as we all know, King Shark.... is a Shark.
===
He is also mode. (Yes I just simultaneously made a stats reference and a Young Justice reference AMA) https://t.co/X2hMbMubqx

@JamesGunn @GailSimone Well, no. Being "The Ruiner" is Gail's job.

King Shark temporarily wins, but there is a new baby Groot. https://t.co/pRcYAVXDdD

I know the answer to this but I don‚Äôt want to ruin it for the rest of you. https://t.co/damaH2c6R4
