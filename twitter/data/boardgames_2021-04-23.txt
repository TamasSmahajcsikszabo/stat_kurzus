@gilliankolla And? Without vaccines, airports that allow variants to flow in by the thousands and forcing an Australian type lock down what else can they do?
I would be on board with you if the provinces were flush with vaccines but they aren‚Äôt and that‚Äôs the game changer.

@IlkayGuendogan Well said. I wasn‚Äôt opposed to a Super League. I was just shocked how poorly it was rolled out. When managers and players aren‚Äôt told then that‚Äôs a problem.

again, I'm not taking a dig at either game.

Is this just a divide between two types of gamers where minis gamers expect core sets to be expensive and board gamers are used to big box games being in the 60-100 dollar range?
===
Genuine question for minis/board gamers.

The minis game on the left is selling for 120 dollars, and so far none of the minis gamers are saying that's expensive

The board game on the right is selling for 150 and a significant portion of the comments were like 'jeez that's steep' https://t.co/9Iby2yrZvw

@ithayla I was a minis gamer before I was a board gamer. Thanks in part to Games Workshop, the mindset I grew up in is "you're buying the minis, the game is a bonus", so when I see a board game like the example, I tend to think "wow, cheap".

I also don't buy a lot of core games.
===
So here's the thing.

Both aspects are vital. Tabletop games, particularly RPGs, are practically unique in that they blend these.

Spectator sports? Totally separate, even if other teams are in the stands.

Board games? You gotta engage the rules, or you're just watching.

@ithayla My perspective? Minis gamers expect to pay $100+ for enough to get started, spend 20+ hours assembling/painting it (a positive for them, a negative for me), and if they like the gameplay, spend 40+ hours playing it. Board gamers expect to pay $60 and play the game 1-4 times.

@1AxelGaming1 @Zuby_Tech highly unlikely
its a new studio were talking about. and not first party. as their first project, they wouldnt be picking an IP owned by others.
in these situations usually the studio comes up with a vision for a new game. Sony is on board to support &amp; be the publishing partner

‚Äúdo not believe/get hyped‚Äù is one of the most powerful things the board has said to me thus far, in control

i... kinda don‚Äôt suspect the board isn‚Äôt *an* ally, and the people who rave about this game aren‚Äôt particularly horny for spec ops and bioshock parlor tricks. i like it!

Part of me thinks that ‚ÄúBeat Bobby Flay‚Äù would be a lot more interesting if, instead of a signature dish, the challenger got to choose a weapon from the board game Clue.

@ithayla wargamers are used to things being expensive, and part of why is that each purchase fuels an arms race. you justify the cost because it'll make your army 'better'.

in a standalone board game with no asymmetric competitive advantage, you lose that psychological push

@DRmzNachos4Life @Shadesogrey @ChristieGolden Seconded! I fell out of touch a while back (a bit after I stopped playing WoW) and I have been meaning to catch back up. I love Warcraft lore, I just burned out on MMOs as a game genre across the board. #Hearthstone is where I do most of my Warcraft gaming these days.

Monopoly is a board game where you play as a animal, vehicle, or a person, the objective is win a lot of money and avoid landing on jail
===
@ithayla Since a lot of board gamers started gaming when games costing more than $100 were really rare, I suspect most are still stuck in the "no game should cost three digits" mindset and have trouble breaking from it.  2/2
===
@ithayla I think it‚Äôs the difference between a ‚Äúlifestyle‚Äù game like most miniatures war games and a board game. A booster box for a TCG is over $100 for just cards, but people buy them. A board game is usually just one small part of a collection, a lifestyle game IS the collection.

@DJLincolndbnb @freezy_joe @SeaOfThieves He also has a sound board by the looks of it, content creation and such.

If you're having issues with "cheaters" I think you need to record them and post there where someone can confirm they're cheating then report to Rare. Cheaters are very uncommon in this game.

@Endore050 I can't say I really agree it was released to try to scam people considering they hyped it a bit and talked about how it has Naka and Oshima on board. I feel like it's a combination of several things that lead to the game turning out the way it is, but unless someone who worked-

@padmeswife Frankly, I'd say it doesn't even compare to SSE on a gameplay level. I mean, isn't the whole point of Adventure Mode to provide a unique experience (namely platforming) from the main game? Instead, World of Light just overlaps with Spirit Board.... and holy fuck does it drag out.

@ConstantRashaad @DanWetzel His two best games were against SC and Arky who were a combined 5-15. Good game against a Florida team that gave up 428 yards of offense a game. Had a good game in a 25 point blow out against the best team he faced, Bama, last year. SEC was way down across the board last year
===
the tabletop rpg market is wired differently, right down to the way product reaches their hands. see, board games don't have a lot of room for small scale projects. even printing 500 copies of a teeeeeny, tiny game is an expensive undertaking that you have to pay for months
===
genuinely productive, sex-positive games, and when you've got employees to write checks to and rent to pay, money becomes an unavoidable part of your decision making process. this makes most adult board game pitches dead on arrival.
===
a layer of humor as self-defense. as board game distribution starts to merge with wider-market distribution, this could change as well, but anyone in the industry will tell you that distribution has been a mess since pre-COVID, so it's hard for most of us on the inside to feel

===
@PrideOfDetroit O line picks are safe generally. A good to great O line transfers to a good to great team. Good line = good run game, better pass protection, and fewer penalties. All of which can equal points on the board, winning time of possession, and keeping a weak defence off the field.

@SamoliansSam @Dd33Dan @EnesKanter @NBA Russell Westbrook is averaging 11 boards a game at 6'3, most point guards simply don't work on their rebounding skill because they shoot from the outside so it's basically impossible to grab a board unless it's defensive

Yankees x Indians o8 -108 (1u)

@atxsammy_ @Kybbr_ @vince3489 @CoolGuyGames I‚Äôd take a weapon kiosk anyday, for trials weapons raid weapons, and so on. Exotics too. Sell all of it for real money.

===
@Kybbr_ @atxsammy_ @vince3489 @CoolGuyGames The difference is investment. You‚Äôre giving the money to the people in charge of designing the game. Much like how the outbreak perfected mission was funded souly through Eververse sales. The same could be the case for future markets in form a weapon Kiosk. I‚Äôm 100% on board

both industries have players just waiting to throw money at their favorite devs/designers/pubs/labels, but the key difference is how much faster board game publishers release product and often at a comparably higher price point

much more than when players are of unequal skill.

Thought 26: This deck was a wild ride to 7-2. Literally every game was close. Hung on by the skin of my teeth after starting 1-2.

@MacGrathCole @KingOfNarwals @Naughty_Dog @Official_AIAS It's an opinion. Personally, TLOU2 is the best game I've ever played, as it did everything exceedingly well across the board. Played many, many games, too. Everyone is entitled to having a favorite game. Again, it's an opinion.

@Emmi_shane On paper I should enjoy it. But I have never gotten into any form of game (card, board, etc.). I can be a bummer of a person to invite to parties. Unless I can find other book-ish and/or theology people to sip whiskey and discuss liberation theology with. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

@farmingsim Looks like FS19 but with a slight update. Would like to see actual gameplay footage so that I'm on board with the release. But looks interesting to follow up on game pictures.

@TheJovenshire I understand its probably contractually not doable but it would be fun to see you play a board game with damien. To answer the other part of the question, you could play gloom.

@TheJovenshire The ghostbusters board game if you have it. (If not let me know)

@missosoupe Remember when Malkin did it to a Habs player and he got penalized but put the player out of the game by injuring his back. The rules have to be the same across the board for "everyone" I mean here we see McDavid throwing elbows like he is giving out Candy and Mackinnon 1/2

Griezmann, Coutinho, Dembele, Pjanic were all terrible decisions. 
Corrupt board led to this tremendous debt.
Worst of all, they are not leaving the Super League just to compensate the financial turmoil.
Could be the last game I watch until football becomes normal again.
