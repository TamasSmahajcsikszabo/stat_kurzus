@BGFSports @CDCarter13 I know where this is going. I’m not really into the gotcha kind of stuff. It’s a little toxic IMO. For me if the COVID vaccine was an effective vaccine you wouldn’t have to wear a mask after you get it.

To answer your question again though, I believe it is a prophylactic.
===
@BGFSports @CDCarter13 I don’t see where what I said was wrong? I said if it was a true vaccine you wouldn’t have to wear a mask, which is true. Since it’s a prophylactic you do...I think we agree on the definition. But a true vaccine gives you immunity like I stated about Polio earlier.

@BolBolDaGoat @derekcarrqb @Dame_Lillard He can't even wear the mask right.

@one_car_lost It happens here too. Will you have the vaccine? I'm still waiting to be offered a vaccine but I do wonder that Covid will keep mutating and the vaccines will not be able to keep up with the virus.

@Allyjambo @RHinsbergh People are avoiding non mask wearers outside, they refuse to be in shops. rooms with them even if they have medical reasons. Most take on looking after themselves &amp; family, esp ppl who are mixing indoors with others. We are at the most dangerous point of the pandemic.
===
@Allyjambo @RHinsbergh The sort of weather we've had recently would  carry the tinier particles of the virus much further than two meters. If you watch a smoker outside their smoke is unpredictable if they are moving. If they were infected much of the virus would be caught in the mask.

@sjreal @PeterMerlinCane @ItsSamG You’re right in theory but if you can’t maintain 6 feet you should wear a mask for your own safety and for others. Indoors it doesn’t matter the distance, if it’s in the air system, circulating, you can get infected even in adjacent room. Donald Trump rally’s are proof enough.

Just saw someone without a mask on... does that mean the pandemic is over?
===
I wish there wasn't such a long delay to get my second Pfizer vaccine. I know things won't be going back to normal for a long time, but I just want to get "waiting for my second jab" off my plate.

Really curious if it’s just the mask or if I am in fact too old to run now.
===
@WasabiRyo @wolfkingvillian There are certain things I'll probably keep doing, like wearing a mask. There's no harm in it, even if I'm the only one.
===
@WasabiRyo @wolfkingvillian I think you might be right. Not everyone will get it, just like not everyone wears a mask. So I'm not as ready to stop being cautious, but I'm glad there's at least this step into making things more like they were.

@FLermyte @mattmecham @caramelized_bat @sailorrooscout I feel thats extremely different from having to wear them all fucking year after the pandemic. I could understnad just wearing ~le facerag~ for 6 weeks (but no 1,5m rules so full theaters etc) to save say 5000 lives every winter.

But thats the limit.

I think the reason why some adults don’t misbehave later in life is because their parents gave them that “Vader look” when they messed up in their younger years (breathing mask and all).

10. The 0.25% CO2 that comes about within a few seconds of donning a mask robs you of your initiative and sense of strategy. You can still carry out basic motor tasks though. https://t.co/VNewm4vOQl
===
3. Sleepiness from lower oxygen and higher CO2 levels inside the mask makes accidents from operating lab equipment or machinery more likely.
 https://t.co/Mzd0r8qPki
===
9. Mental health: 60% of Germans report serious psycho-social damage due to the mask mandate, e.g. social withdrawal, reduced health self-care (e.g.  avoiding doctor's appointments) or the intensification of prior health problems (PTSD, herpes, migraines)
https://t.co/veGNBzy105
===
4. Skin damage: 41.5% of staff wearing a mask &lt;6 hours a day reported skin damage to their cheeks, rising to 58.5% for &gt;6 hours. The skin damage suffered ranged from mild (desquamation, i.e. peeling skin, 62.2% of participants) to serious (ulcers, 10.1%).
https://t.co/pZSOBOSr1H
===
Here's a list of 12 papers showing the health damage that wearing a mask causes. 
1. Headaches: subjects wearing surgical masks experienced an average 4.9 days of headaches in 77 days compared to 1.3 days for those without masks. 
https://t.co/MAuR2xz79O
===
12. Wearing a mask all day doesn’t even work in its own terms. After 2 hours subjects emitted as many bacteria as if they weren’t wearing a mask. https://t.co/eKOua8C5bQ
===
@SNL33937029 @DancerDad @dollytrollpe The skin damage that long-term mask wearing causes should be well known. Sadly it isn't because the Government despises you and your family and wants to destroy you. https://t.co/ZTzHLhhhnu
===
2. Self-contamination: People who have received no training in how to don a mask, how to avoid touching it and their faces, and how to safely remove it are very likely to contaminate themselves, since medically trained staff do so.
 https://t.co/6AkE7H83j3

5. Staphylococcal skin infections such as impetigo, while usually a problem for young children, have been shown to be caused in adults by mask wearing.

Need some help. A vaccine should stop a disease/virus from effecting you. Example  measles.  The COVID vaccine IMO is a souped up flu shot. It lasts 6 mos and you will probably need another shot. How is it a vaccine?  More importantly why is everyone referring to it as a vaccine?
