@KLoeffler @MLB @Braves One might think that giving a GOP-majority state board the power to seize the powers of county elections officials and thereby “legally” change a result they are unhappy reason enough to move the game. Dont try to spin this as your "woke" BS.

The board is completely modeled and textured, including the back which I can't remember seeing in the game. https://t.co/B80jJYzw8J

@SilverAgeTV Great show!

And was the first board game I owned.  Played it relentlessly.

@HawksDraftNerd I’m extremely high on James Bouknight. Have him at 6 on my big board. I think he can be an all-star, elite three level scorer and with a nice handle as well. I love his game.

@Gothalion all around the board i see a decent game that has no massive low or high, irritation with servers ( scratching my head because it’s peer2peer ) my biggest problem is a mouse bug that keeps bouncing to other monitors and opening programs while trying to play the game.

No one asked but as a connoisseur of irl games (mainly tabletop, board, and party) and without even touching the cultural issues with it....

In the late 90’s Tomb Raider had a trading card game. The interesting part is that it played more like a board game (You would explore and fight others in a tomb &amp; it could be played solo).

I'm really a fan of TyTy Washington's game. The athleticism is impressive. He can make open shots, but it's more about the ability to get into the lane and make something happen — a pass, finish or just forcing help.

Then you watch him grab a board and go end to end. Special.

Wow we are shit! Honestly i dont get cooper at all... whittaker on when the game is dead! Sticking with lowe....is he watching the same game as us supporters? And the board need to invest!

@KikoEnjani I know the feeling - not even sure when my docs will decide it's safe for me to actually go to places with people in them. :( In the past, though, I've found a shared activity works - hence why I've had good luck with board game cafes. I hear good things about volunteering, too.
===
@KikoEnjani I think it's very often through having a situation in common and being on a similar social footing - like for me it's been situations like "moved into the same street as a couple broadly similar in age/interests", or "hung out at the same board game cafe" - admittedly harder rn.

@badams @RemcoTensen @alexhardy I have avoided all that - very toxic and not needed in a balanced life. I game occasionally but do not consider myself a gamer because of it.

@TylerKepner @gtconway3d Too bad it’s actually Cobb County GA that lost the game which just elected it’s first all female board of commissioners and Chairwoman and now predominantly Democratic.

@Bandook_ @TriLoSZN @The_CrapGamer Yeah, objectively the story is great. Objectively the gameplay is solid. Objectively the visuals are stunning (for the time of release). The numbers don’t lie, man. GOTY, 5 stars, 10/10 across the board. If the game was as bad as you say, those would be lower.

Beato lay there silently, like a living doll with dull eyes...
The game board that she had created herself had been hijacked by incomprehensible people and was being turned into a mess...
If I was designated to be her opponent... Then Beato must have created this game for me.

@jimkerr369 @_Toukana I'm not surprised Dorfromantik has been a hit with my tweeps. Most of us are board gamers and this hits that sweet spot between aesthetics, game play, and overall experience. I'm so happy you're enjoying it. (I feel the same - I had to force myself to quit and go to bed!)

@siIver_wind @TMannu6 Of course, but the cause of that wasn't a video game or board game or whatever the video happened to be about EXACTLY, which is the point of what I'm saying. I don't think Drow all being evil because of their evil goddess will MAKE anyone think "Oh, all [race] is just evil."
===
@siIver_wind @TMannu6 This argument is all over the place here, and I sincerely don't get it. If you're an actual child, maybe, but has anyone played a video game or board game and went "Oh, this is life. People are all their racial archetypes, got it," based on pure fiction, much less high fantasy? https://t.co/PcXr5Pl03e

Seigfried is a matchup I find very difficult, but I had hoped to at least get one game on the board. A few silly mistakes, misinputs, and drops shattered that for me. That’s not to say Jorge wasn’t the better player—he adjusted to me way better than I to him and rightfully won.

A $400 board game and bag sweepstakes from @BGTables! https://t.co/c8TUJpB34o

@WFCOfficial @HarrogateTown Bit late for "promising". The most winnable game we had left and in the end we were hanging on for a draw. Our only hope now is Southend dropping more points as we won't be winning any. As much as you can blame BD you also have to look at the board for that awful transfer window.

Currently thinking about Her.
(Her being the one nice person in my nightmare I just woke up from. She let me mess about with her circuit board game console &amp; gave me a second one as a gift when I got the controls working. She worried about me when we got involved in a car crash.)

Went to a mate's house and apparently he has the Pink Flamingos boardgame. I didn't even know there was a Pink Flamingos boardgame.
I can only begin to imagine what it takes to win this game and therefore should probably give it a hard pass.

This game’s about 60 moves in. The other pieces enjoy hitting and kicking the ones next to them if at all possible so it helps half the pieces have been taken off the board. I’m currently one of three remaining Pawns; I tell my other pieces where to go and they eventually obey.

@inari_tnd Totally!! I always think about how you can tell a story only with the gameplay on a board game... I mean, in a videogame it's more clear to me, but with a few cards, a board, a few miniatures... must be something peculiar. Maybe it all revolves around flavor, world-building, etc?

the problem is, yugioh doesn't have a limiter that stops you from doing everything turn 1. so the game has reached the point where it devolves into comboing off turn 1, building a board that's nearly impossible to negate, or trying to snipe them mid combo so they dont do that
