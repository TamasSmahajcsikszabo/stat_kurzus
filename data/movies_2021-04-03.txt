Check out my review of the movie which killed the Biblical epic genre, Ridley Scott's 2014 film Exodus: Gods and Kings.

I do wonder what some folks mean using the word “dumb” to describe a genre film. 

If it’s “characters were weak/storyline was too simplistic/etc” then hey, fair enough.

If they mean “this is a movie about aliens/giant monsters/etc. and is therefore dumb” then I got beef.
===
I never thought the "movie that takes place entirely on a computer screen" genre could work - and there's still a lot of ways it can go very wrong - but I've now seen a couple of movies that pull off this trick really, really well.
===
@LeighMonsonPBF I feel like monster movies are unusually divisive! People come to them for different things, I guess. Like, if a monster movie takes itself 100% seriously, I'm out, but a lot of people want that kind of story too. Idk what it is about the genre.

@TMosychuk @DawnoftheUnd3ad @CBThorburn The movie genre he is making fun of in this video is not satiracl though. It's like unironically offensive punching down for 90 minutes.

@FannibalMovemnt It’s unbelievable how Hannibal show was canceled. Storieline,sets&amp;acting was high level of performance. What people need to remember Silence of the Lambs was expertly crafted. The movie received high acclaim not only in it’s genre across the board. Hannibal the same

@deathcab4booty i think its so underrated because millennials dont understand "vietnam movies" as a genre anymore. the first person i talked to about it who didnt like it i was like "well i just think its cool to make a vietnam monster movie again" and they were like "a what??"
===
Tonight we have watched Twister following by Tremors. Is there a better genre than the natural disaster movie?

@SumoFollower @sell2move Yeah.  That’s the genre of movie in itself.  Did I suggest a comedy or a musical? No.  I did not.

If your life was a movie, what genre would it be primarily? — Everyone’s life can be a movie. Movies are life stories. Well most movies anyway. My movie would be boring. There’s no title to an ordinary person’s life. https://t.co/mMDpc7SG27
===
@HamzaMacabago I’m gonna have to say Given. I was never really a fan of the romance genre and I basically only watched Shonen, but after a friend said it was good I finally watched it after a while and was amazed. The movie was pretty good too, but I think the series is better by a lot. https://t.co/HeyAE3r4qc

@marveIgain What's your favorite movie and music genre/s?

@collin_doucet @GemOfAmara Exactly, and I'm fine with that. 

Solidly put together genre shows that just do their thing with a modicum of fuss are all too rare,  now.

Especially on premier networks.
===
@DangervilleTeam While the fights are probably the best in the Monsterverse, ones you expend and put it next to others of the genre (Ultraman, Gamera hell even other Godzilla movies), they aren't really special.
This is also the most empty feeling Godzilla movie I've seen in a while.

@John_Dantzler We raised our kids on a steady diet of everything (musical-genre/era-wise).

@MattGertz That's not quite fair, it's a giant monster movie. Cinematic genius isn't part of the genre. For what it is? It's a decent popcorn movie

im really happy that the genre "american ecchi movie" is dead

@withenoughprep1 @TheLichMan2 @brookstweetz If you can’t see the social commentary of the real world that’s on you bro. Man of Steel and BvS flipped the comic book movie genre on its head. Watchmen was good, but the book is the reason for its commentary. MoS and BvS are different.

@b3rn1997 For sure,  I just feel like that’s a thing with the genre as a whole to where I’m expecting the humans to be boring and one dimensional. I think this movie was one of the best of this monsterverse because Godzilla and Kong had a good chunk of screen time

I think we live in a world where it's fine to acknowledge a dumb popcorn movie and more thought provoking movies as both sides of a genre

===
@HumongousPizzas They act like any Godzilla movie had good human character writing, the entire genre is big monster fights other big monster, the humans are just there to further the plot enough so it's not just a 10 minute monster fight

My favorite genre of movie is when people talk shit on the internet then get dragged to the point of deactivation

@Akitron I don't even know the characters but it's so mean spirited to make that kind of post coded towards a specific audience to laugh at them.

===
Goddamn this movie is making me levitate by clearing the very low bar of being a) stylistically confident and b) fun to watch right off the bat. Why did Hollywood forget that genre movies are supposed to do that

A good genre movie makes you feel like you and the director are sharing a wavelength. You’re in on a joke together and you both think swords are cool. This applies regardless of the presence of jokes and/or swords in the film

Day 55 - Doll on a Music Box from Chitty Chitty Bang Bang

I consider 80s-90s the golden age of comedy films. 2000s were good until the rise of the scuffed parody genre, where "parody" meant bottom of the barrel pop culture jokes about shit you’d see on E! News or whatever. The Scary Movie franchise is the bane of my existence.

@mellyfratelli @rosstmiller I mean, if a company makes a great trailer for a bad movie, kudos to them – that’s some impressive advertising. It’s when the trailer makes the film look like it’s a different genre or tone that the knives need to come out.

It sucks the Rampage movie wasn't closer to the source material. I've never been a huge kaiju fan but I like the idea of a spoofy deconstruction of the genre.

lol I think Out Cold was my fav movie from this era/genre I'll have to rewatch it. https://t.co/P3kspwi6Ls
===
yeah I'll chime in
#ContinueTheMonsterverse with a female director (AND writer)
It's been 66+ (close to 90 if we're talking the genre intself) years let's get a change of perspective going.
===
@KingofMunsters1 @MvM_Pod I'm shouting it to the rooftops that the next director should be a woman. A woman has never directed a major giant monster property in the nearly 90 year existence of the genre
===
Don't. 

Just stop. 

This has been explained by more articulate people than I countless times. 

The "best" person over a nearly 90 year history of the genre has always been men. Grow up.

@RSims58 @SorenPetro I’ve seen this movie before just a different genre. Later on in the contract and Bill becomes old and senile, hires his son and postpones his retirement unless his son is named HC
===
@shara_is_me @paularun054 I am also reminded of my favourite drama genre "Theatre of Absurd" where absurdities of life are presented ...one of such playwrights Henrik Ibsen wrote "Majority are always wrong, minority is rarely right. " Makes sense ? Absurdities you know !!
===
@danielyeich 2001: 2hr 44m runtime
A Ghost Story: 1hr 32m runtime. 

The difference is epic. Ones a masterful craft for sure, while another if a work far greater than most of the best work in cinema. <U+0001F937><U+0001F3FC><U+200D>><U+FE0F> 

Definitely a hot take here bud. 

Not a lot of comparison in genre either.

@iamSincereSayar memorable film in almost every genre he has done than any other actor working right now in btown

DAY 1

<U+2728>Panic Room<U+2728>

Starring the magnificent Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart.

This movie is in the typical home invasion genre taking a leap on the story of mother and daughter. The movie is predictable yet the thrill is superb. This is available on Netflix.

This is 8/10.

You in fact will be hard pressed to find a high school themed movie that does not use an adult actor to push a "look how hot that person is" narrative.

It is the default...

our default teen film genre involves sexualizing minors.

@bombsfall It’s a solid monster movie!!! I always say this. Like it would be a GREAT movie period with like one or two fewer human sideplots but it is still a fantastic movie in its genre.

Black female filmmaker is fucked up in its own right. Now I know Ava isn’t a filmmaker on the rise, but in cinema, particularly in the CBM genre, women &amp; women of color, and more specifically Black women are HIGHLY underrepresented, and just because Ava is one of the greatest…

As biased as I might be having worked on this movie I have to say this movie is a tonne of fun. Real throwback to the creature features from the 80/90s and it beautifully nails it’s genre mash up with real aplomb too https://t.co/jmXo41lFCc https://t.co/7NHhKwRXY8

@Darren_Mooney It's painful to see as I was excited for DC films to be a genuine director driven counterpart to the MCU where directors who didn't have a place in that franchise could still work and do stuff to push the genre forward

But WB wants to be like Disney and make easy fan service
===
@wyattyhalpert @R2IsGood I was really excited for DC films to be a genuine counterpart to the MCU in being a franchise which was willing to make more director driven films that would push the genre forward

I still believe they're capable of achieving that

The fake persecuted attitude that Comic Book movie fans have is literally the worst thing about the whole genre and it’s fan base. Sorry y’all, nerd culture is mainstream is fuck now, just like damn near everything else, even shit I use to love. Get a grip.

@bryanedwardhill @mattzollerseitz I don’t bother with reviews really. Sometimes I will read some though. But mostly I watch what I think I’ll enjoy due to genre or actors. Whatever you do though, do NOT watch Juijitsu on Netflix. It has surpassed Battlefield Earth as the worst movie ever.

After a long time went to the first show of a movie today - #Sulthan - and I had nalla fun.

The atrocious trailer does no justice to this damn interesting film. Guess @prabhu_sr has another winner on his hands and @Karthi_Offl continues to explore well in the masala genre.

@GhoulishlyRaven @radiantbutch @EnbyChaotic ...and every comedy had moments of tragedy, for contrast. And some plays don't fit neatly into one of those two genres, such as The Merchant of Venice.

With the rise of cinema, we now know that we can be as specific as we want when describing genre.
===
@GhoulishlyRaven @radiantbutch @EnbyChaotic You can enjoy them without knowing all the categories, yeah, but genre helps people know what they're about to watch, or helps them work out what they're most interested in.

Aaaaand that's basically gender. We're just movie genres. That's all. :)

@erikaishii this movie hammered home the message of “It’s not a question of cam we do it, the true question is should we do it” regarding scientific and technological advancement. It was this movie that made me truly fall in love with the science fiction genre. It’s not just a monster movie.

I mean, we’re halfway through the movie &amp; no zombie invasion yet. Just a lot of flat characters with not much to do. And it’s a bit insulting towards small town America to boot.

@MarxIsMyNigga I love the implication that a movie in which men hug for two minutes is immediately a “gay movie” like, that’s the genre

This is all to say, if all you want is “munky punch lizurd” and you got that, great! If you were expecting more and were disappointed, also great! But it’s one movie. Can we please stop making it about the entire goddamn genre? Thanks.
===
@BrianG1227 @edenjoking @CBMShampoo @DiamondSpiderP I think there's levels. "Comic book" doesn't, nor should it, mean one thing. A Spider-Man book by Brian Bendis isn't gonna have the same tone as Jeph Loeb Batman or Ed Brubaker Captain America. The idea that a movie has to be goofy or camp to be a CBM does the whole genre dirty.

===
@PolitiksCommon @ComicBook She's barely been working as a director. She only had one hit, a low-budget indie in a totally different genre. There is zero in her resume to suggest she's qualified to direct a sci-fi/fantasy epic like New Gods. And WB does not have a producer like Kevin Feige to save the film.
===
@Neb153 Who's sad? Let's please keep a totally unqualified director with no track record of success in genre films, who lost $131 million on her first big-budget film, out of the DCEU. She would kill New Gods as badly as DC killed Green Lantern with the Reynolds film.
===
@PanicJrCress Yeah, 
it’s embarrassing how a lot of people, both fans and the casual audience, reduce the genre to having to be just mindless schlock.

It being a giant monster movie doesn’t excuse bad writing/ plot.

@Trad_West_Art I felt it. It wasn't super original and the Batman lore was shoe-horned in there. But I found the performance, the violence and desperate nihilism sadly compelling.

@HopeJustice1938 "either"? Oh no, WB was dumb enough to ask King to write the movie Ava was directing.

To answer your question, NO ONE. I have no idea what WB was thinking. King's appeal is far too narrow and DuVernay has proven that fantasy is not her genre.
===
Watched the new Godzilla VS Kong movie in the theater and my suspicions were correct- I will cry during any movie regardless of the genre ayyyyyyyyyye
===
Oftentimes people will get snobby and say that a director is too good for the genre. Which is absurd. It's okay if a genre isn't your thing. For example, I don't like westerns. But you wouldn't say someone is "too good" for one.
===
@KatInTheCLE Netflix? If so, try the series Who killed Sarah or a European trilogy based on the Batzan Trilogy of books. First movie is the invisible guardian. It is crime drama. I love the movie Kiss the girls, not that good, but in that genre.

@lexiatommo favourite genre of movie?

Okay, pretend I'm someone who barely watches new movies and maybe sees 10 a year.

Recommend me a movie! Any movie, any genre. There's a good chance I haven't seen it. (Though if I have I will excitedly reply IVE ACTUALLY SEEN THIS ONE!)

@SonnyBunch There's a whole genre of clout-seeking social media post trying to own basic white guys/racist white guys' movie &amp; TV &amp; book tastes by listing a bunch of great movies &amp; shows &amp; books that lots of people of all races love.
===
@PDXtroyboy @ClinicCapp Yep. It's the book series to the TERRIBLE movie Eragon. It has Dragons, elves, magic, kingdoms etc. Super great 4 book series I can't recommend enough to people who enjoy the fantasy genre
===
@emohorgan It will be my gut at a broad level. But anything for teen and below.

Honestly, when it comes to genre, that's my own proprietary system. No automatic system (IMDb, NFLX, etc) works as well as my system.

@CultureCrave @EW This is definitely the time to do it, now that people are more excepting of movies in a series not being in the same genre every time. I’d love to see a movie that has almost no humans, as well as one where the monsters are only sparingly see
===
@4dropintheocean Yeah, that's how a lot of that genre of movie is. They play in smaller theaters and get so much less distribution. But EXCELLENT storytelling.

One of the best horror films ever made and one of my favourites in this genre. A horror,folklore and psychological all- in-one film!

@PaulHewton_82 Clint Eastwood's first movie that wasn't in the Western genre.

Apparently he was quite nervous about doing it.

(Sorry, can't find the link for the interview where Eastwood was discussing it.)
===
But no matter which reward levels you choose, it all means a great deal to Bobby and all the other great people that worked on VENGEANCE TURNS. It means that you're supporting a *truly* independent movie made by people because they love the genre and they love making art.

If they do another Kong movie that leans into the giant b-movie genre flourishes of Skull Island, but set on the Hollow Earth I will see it five times in theaters.

JESUS CHRIST he just American History X'd a robot gorilla and it was twice as gruesome! If you've seen that movie, you'll know what I mean.

It's a different genre.....
===
I am going to say something, as the movie is now over, without spoilers. In the history of Nick Cage movies,

And YES, Nick Cage movies are a genre unto themselves,

This is possibly the greatest Nick Cage movie ever made.
===
Pretty good movie. George Clooney, Felicity Jones and her story´s crew are great. I like the two stories and how they meet, I liked watching both. It´s not groundbreaking, it can be slow and has some genre clichés but it is enjoyable. #TheMidnightSky #GeorgeClooney #FelicityJones https://t.co/JtdygrJgH4
===
The genre could really use a refresh of the movie that launched the genre. Perhaps impossible to recapture the magic as/in a remake, though.
===
what type of movie genre is their favorite
===
@CareySupreme it might be as well bc of their sound? your eyes tell, crystal snow, film out, etc. base from bts jp originals, their songs really fits drama/movies. so they got more offers on that types. unless there would be some anime movie/series with a drama genre, etc.
===
@Struggler2Dark Versus movies are a very ape brain type of genre. There’s probably some sort underlying narrative with themes, but the big spectacle of it all is the fights.

I’m glad GvK really delivered on the action, with only like one really bad thing about the whole movie.
===
What is your dream genre of movie you have always wished to play in? #askgaten

@MASKEDMANIACXXX These are all excepted in the awesome movie genre

@AceSchubert02 The trench could’ve been a cool horror movie,I would like the comic book genre to expand a little more like a Scarecrow horror movie
===
May seem off to type risky bet about a superhero movie in 2021, but there are safer guarantees even within the most popular film genre on earth. There's a reason Marvel Studios did not follow Avengers in 2012 with The Eternals. 

DC Films is in an infancy once again in many ways.
===
If you could film the story of your life - which genre would the movie be?  
        (if this tweet goes viral I'll reveal mine)
===
That was great. How did this whole genre of movie disappear????
===
@MrJeffMan @RonGula And from that Godzilla comes the MonsterVerse which is a series of films that all build on that legend, and allows warping to mold and extend it. Kong was an AWESOME monster movie, and scratched a lot of itches for the genre. I haven't seen the last 2 yet but very excited!

Superhero costumes should be campy. Elements shouldn't serve a specific purpose. Forget about superhero movie costumes, it's trash. We don't need this influence in comics.

Movie Recommendation: NOBADI (2019)

For the first forty-five minutes, you'll wonder why this Austrian film was programmed at genre film festivals. For the last fifteen, you'll be trying not to puke all over your popcorn. GRAN TORINO-style racial tensions go off-the-rails. https://t.co/In3GqiOWrZ
